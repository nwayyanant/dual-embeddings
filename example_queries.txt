Then, in the village he reached, the people offered him alms with great enthusiasm. He finished his meal, returned to the hermitage, sat down, and reflected: ""I did not go forth into homelessness because I could not obtain food. Indeed, rich food increases conceit, pride, and the pride of being a man. There is no end to the suffering rooted in food. What if I were to abandon food that is sown, planted, and produced from grain, and instead subsist on fallen fruits?"" From that time on, acting in this manner, striving and exerting himself, he brought forth the eight attainments and the five higher knowledges (abhiññā) within seven days. Therefore, it was said:"

Search: What is the meaning of Dhamma in the context of understanding reality as it is?
Answer:
abh01a.att,188,"Aparo nayo – dhammoti hetu. Vuttañhetaṃ – ‘‘hetumhi ñāṇaṃ dhammapaṭisambhidā’’ti (vibha. 720). Atthoti hetuphalaṃ. Vuttañhetaṃ – ‘‘hetuphale ñāṇaṃ atthapaṭisambhidā’’ti (vibha. 720). Desanāti paññatti, yathādhammaṃ dhammābhilāpoti adhippāyo; anulomapaṭilomasaṅkhepavitthārādivasena vā kathanaṃ. Paṭivedhoti abhisamayo. So ca lokiyalokuttaro. Visayato ca asammohato ca; atthānurūpaṃ dhammesu, dhammānurūpaṃ atthesu, paññattipathānurūpaṃ paññattīsu avabodho. Tesaṃ tesaṃ vā tattha tattha vuttadhammānaṃ paṭivijjhitabbo salakkhaṇasaṅkhāto aviparītasabhāvo.","Another method: **Dhamma** means cause (hetu). For it has been said: ""Knowledge of the cause is analysis of Dhamma (dhammapaṭisambhidā)."" **Meaning (attha)** means the result of the cause (hetuphala). For it has been said: ""Knowledge of the cause and its result is analysis of meaning (atthapaṭisambhidā)."" **Teaching (desanā)** means designation (paññatti), the intention being the correct verbal expression (dhammābhilāpa) of the Dhamma; or it is the explanation by way of order (anuloma), reverse order (paṭiloma), summary, elaboration, and so forth. **Penetration (paṭivedha)** means realization (abhisamaya). And that is mundane and supramundane. And from the point of view of object and freedom from delusion: comprehension of Dhamma according to its meaning, of meaning according to its Dhamma, and of designations according to the manner of designation. Or it is the undeluded nature, called specific characteristic, of those various Dhammas taught here and there, which is to be penetrated."
-> Understanding reality as it is involves understanding causes and results/effects. Causes/hetu are called Dhamma and effects/results are called phala. It is said "hetumhi ñāṇaṃ dhammapaṭisambhidā" = "knowledge of the cause is analysis of Dhamma."

Answer: 
abh01a.att,110,"Katamo  ñāṇasāgaro? Sabbaññutaññāṇaṃ ñāṇasāgaro nāma. Ayaṃ saṃsārasāgaro nāma, ayaṃ jalasāgaro nāma, ayaṃ nayasāgaro nāmāti hi aññena na sakkā jānituṃ, sabbaññutaññāṇeneva sakkā jānitunti sabbaññutaññāṇaṃ ñāṇasāgaro nāma. Imesu catūsu sāgaresu imasmiṃ ṭhāne nayasāgaro adhippeto. Imañhi sabbaññubuddhāva paṭivijjhanti.","Omniscient knowledge is called the ocean of knowledge. Indeed, to know “This is the ocean of saṃsāra, this is the ocean of water, this is the ocean of methods” is not possible by any other knowledge; it is possible only by omniscient knowledge. Therefore, omniscient knowledge is called the ocean of knowledge. This is called the ocean of saṃsāra, this is called the ocean of water, this is called the ocean of method (nayasāgara); it cannot be known by any other means, it can only be known by omniscience, thus omniscience is called the ocean of knowledge. Among these four oceans, in this context (of commenting on the Abhidhamma Pāli), the ""ocean of method"" (nayasāgara) is intended. Indeed, only the Omniscient Buddhas penetrate this."
abh01a.att,111,"Ayampi bhagavā bodhimūle nisinno ‘imaṃ paṭivijjhitvā imaṃ vata me dhammaṃ esantassa gavesantassa kappasatasahassādhikāni cattāri asaṅkhyeyyāni vītivattāni, atha me imasmiṃ pallaṅke nisinnena diyaḍḍhakilesasahassaṃ khepetvā ayaṃ dhammo paṭividdho’ti paṭividdhadhammaṃ paccavekkhanto sattāhaṃ ekapallaṅkena nisīdi.

Tato devatānaṃ ‘ajjāpi nūna siddhatthassa  kattabbakiccaṃ atthi, pallaṅkasmiñhi ālayaṃ na vijahatī’ti parivitakko udapādi.","This Blessed One, too, seated at the foot of the Bodhi tree, having penetrated this Dhamma, reflected upon the Dhamma He had penetrated, thinking: ‘Indeed, in seeking and searching for this Dhamma, four incalculable aeons and a hundred thousand aeons have passed for me. Then, seated on this very seat, by destroying one and a half thousand defilements, this Dhamma has been penetrated by me.’ Thus reflecting, He sat for seven days in a single cross-legged posture. Then, rising from that seat, He stood for seven days, gazing at the seat with unblinking eyes, thinking: ‘Indeed, it was on this very seat that omniscience was penetrated by me.’ Then, the thought arose in the devas: ‘Surely, Siddhattha still has some task to accomplish, for he does not abandon his attachment to the seat.’"
abh01a.att,112,"Satthā devatānaṃ vitakkaṃ ñatvā tāvadeva tāsaṃ vitakkavūpasamanatthaṃ vehāsaṃ abbhuggantvā yamakapāṭihāriyaṃ dassesi. Mahābodhipallaṅkasmiñhi katapāṭihāriyañca, ñātisamāgame katapāṭihāriyañca, pāṭiyaputtasamāgame katapāṭihāriyañca, sabbaṃ kaṇḍambarukkhamūle katayamakapāṭihāriyasadisameva ahosi.

Imesu ca ekavīsatiyā divasesu ekadivasepi satthu sarīrato rasmiyo na nikkhantā.","The Teacher, knowing the devas’ thought, at that very moment ascended into the sky to calm their thoughts and displayed the Twin Miracle (Yamakapāṭihāriya). Indeed, the miracle performed near the Mahābodhi seat, the miracle performed at the gathering of relatives, and the miracle performed at the gathering related to Pāṭiyaputta—all were similar to the Twin Miracle performed at the foot of the Gaṇḍamba tree. Having thus performed the Twin Miracle, He descended from the sky between the place where the seat was and the place where He stood, and walked for seven days. And during these twenty-one days, not on a single day did rays emanate from the Teacher's body."
-> The Buddha performed the Twin Miracle.
