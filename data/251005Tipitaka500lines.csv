Atirekavisesatthadīpako hettha ‘abhi’-saddo. ‘‘Bāḷhā me dukkhā vedanā abhikkamanti no paṭikkamanti’’ (ma. ni. 3.384; saṃ. ni. 5.195) ‘‘abhikkantavaṇṇā’’tiādīsu (saṃ. ni. 1.1-2) viya.

It is called Abhidhamma by reason of being an exceeding Dhamma and a distinguished Dhamma. Here, the prefix ‘abhi-’ indicates an exceeding and distinguished meaning. Like in phrases such as “My painful feelings, friend, are severe, they increase, they do not decrease” and “of distinguished complexion.” Therefore, just as among many parasols and banners set up, that parasol which is of exceeding size and of distinguished color and form is called ‘atichatta’ (exceeding parasol), and that banner which is of exceeding size and endowed with various distinguished colors is called ‘atidhaja’ (exceeding banner); and just as among many princes and devas gathered together, that prince who is exceedingly superior and more distinguished in terms of birth, wealth, fame, sovereignty, and so on, is called ‘atirājakumāro’ (exceeding prince), and that deva who is exceedingly superior and more distinguished in terms of life-span, complexion, sovereignty, fame, prosperity, and so on, is called ‘atidevo’ (exceeding deva); similarly, a Brahmā of such a nature is also called ‘atibrahmā’ (exceeding Brahmā). Just so, this Dhamma is called **‘Abhidhamma’** by reason of being an exceeding Dhamma and a distinguished Dhamma."

Evaṃ dhammātirekadhammavisesaṭṭhena abhidhammoti veditabbo.","Indeed, in the Suttantas, the five aggregates are analyzed only partially, not completely; but upon reaching the Abhidhamma, they are analyzed completely by means of the Suttantabhājanīya, Abhidhammabhājanīya, and Pañhapucchaka methods. Similarly, the twelve āyatanas, the eighteen dhātus, the four noble truths, the twenty-two indriyas, and the twelve-linked paṭiccasamuppāda. It is only in the Indriyavibhaṅga that there is no Suttantabhājanīya, and in the Paccayākāra there is no Pañhapucchaka. And in the Suttantas, the four foundations of mindfulness are analyzed only partially, not completely; but upon reaching the Abhidhamma, they are analyzed completely by means of all three methods. Similarly, the four right exertions, the four bases of psychic power, the seven factors of enlightenment, the Noble Eightfold Path, the four jhānā, the four boundless states (brahmavihāras), the five precepts, and the four paṭisambhidā. Only in the Sikkhāpadavibhaṅga is there no Suttantabhājanīya. And in the Suttantas, knowledge is analyzed only partially, not completely; similarly, defilements. But upon reaching the Abhidhamma, knowledge is analyzed completely, starting from the Mātikā, by the method of “one kind of basis of knowledge,” and so on. Similarly, defilements are analyzed in many ways, starting from the single category. And in the Suttantas, the delineation of different planes of existence is analyzed only partially, not completely; but upon reaching the Abhidhamma, the delineation of different planes of existence is analyzed completely by means of all three methods. Thus, it should be understood that Abhidhamma means Dhamma that is exceeding and distinguished Dhamma."

Kathāvatthunāva saddhiṃ sattā’ti.","Furthermore, this Abhidhamma stands by reason of its division into seven treatises: Dhammasaṅgaṇī, Vibhaṅga, Dhātukathā, Puggalapaññatti, Kathāvatthu, Yamaka, and Paṭṭhāna. This is the common discourse among the teachers. However, the cavilling disputant says: ‘Why is the Kathāvatthu included? Was it not composed by the Elder Moggaliputtatissa two hundred and eighteen years after the Parinibbāna of the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One? Therefore, since it was spoken by a disciple, reject it!’ ‘But is the Abhidhamma only six treatises?’ ‘I do not say so.’ ‘Then what do you say?’ ‘Seven treatises.’ ‘Which one do you take to make seven?’ ‘There is one called Mahādhammāhadaya; with this, there are seven.’ ‘In Mahādhammāhadaya there is nothing new; only a few question-sections remain, so with Kathāvatthu alone there are seven.’ ‘No, not with Kathāvatthu. There is one called Mahādhātukathā; with that, there are seven.’ ‘In Mahādhātukathā there is nothing new; only a very small amount of Pāḷi remains. With Kathāvatthu alone, there are seven.’"

That Mātika, however, is: ‘‘Is a person apprehended in the sense of a true ultimate reality? Yes. Is that person apprehended in the sense of a true ultimate reality as separate from that which is true ultimate reality? It should not be said thus. Understand the rebuttal…pe… Is a person not apprehended in the sense of a true ultimate reality? Yes.

Is a person apprehended everywhere, is a person not apprehended everywhere, is a person apprehended always, is a person not apprehended always, is a person apprehended in all things, is a person not apprehended in all things, in the sense of a true ultimate reality?’’ It was established by the Teacher, showing the first rebuttal based on the first argument, the second based on the second…pe… the eighth based on the eighth. In this manner, the establishment of the Mātika everywhere should be understood. When establishing this Mātika, He established it having foreseen this: ‘‘After two hundred and eighteen years from my parinibbāna, a monk named **Moggaliputtatissa Thera**, sitting amidst a thousand monks, will divide the Kathāvatthu treatise, which is as extensive as the Dīgha Nikāya, by combining five hundred suttas for his own school and five hundred for other schools, making a total of one thousand suttas.’’"

Thus, because it was expounded by means of the Mātika established by the Teacher according to the method He gave, this entire treatise became known as the Buddha’s discourse. Like what? Like the Madhupiṇḍika Suttanta and others. For in the Madhupiṇḍika Suttanta, the Blessed One laid down the Mātika: ‘‘Bhikkhu, that from which the ideas and concepts of proliferation arise for a person—if there is nothing to be delighted in, to be spoken of, or to be clung to there, that is the end of the latent tendencies of passion,’’ and rising from His seat, He entered the monastery."

The Thera, without answering merely upon being asked, in order to show reverence for the Ten-Powered One, brought forth the simile of the essence by saying: ‘‘Just as, friends, a man in need of heartwood, seeking heartwood,’’ (implying that the Blessed One is like the heartwood tree, and the disciples are like its branches and leaves). He praised the Teacher, saying: ‘‘Indeed, friends, that Blessed One knows what is to be known, sees what is to be seen; He is the Eye, the Knowledge, the Dhamma, the Brahmā; He is the Speaker, the Expounder, the Leader to the meaning, the Giver of the Deathless, the Lord of Dhamma, the Tathāgata.’’ Being repeatedly entreated by the elder monks, he then explained the meaning of the Mātika established by the Teacher and sent them away, saying: ‘‘If you, venerable sirs, desire, you may go and ask the Blessed One Himself about this matter. If it agrees when compared with the omniscience, you may accept it; if not, do not accept it.’’ And so, with this intention, he said: ‘‘You should bear it in mind just as the Blessed One explains it to you.’’"

The Teacher, without saying ‘‘Kaccāna has explained it poorly,’’ but rather raising His neck as if lifting a golden bell, filling His great mouth, radiant like a fully bloomed lotus, and emitting a Brahmā-like voice, gave His approval to the Thera by saying, ‘‘Good, good! Bhikkhus, Mahākaccāna is wise; bhikkhus, Mahākaccāna possesses great wisdom. Even if you, bhikkhus, were to ask me about this matter, I would explain it to you in exactly the same way as Mahākaccāna has explained it.’’"

And for Abhidhamma bhikkhus, as they reflect on the Abhidhamma tradition, endless joy and happiness arise, thinking, “Our Teacher indeed showed how to differentiate between aggregates, between sense-bases, between elements, between faculties, between powers and factors of enlightenment, between karma and its results, and how to precisely distinguish between matter and mind, dividing subtle phenomena into part after part, section after section, as if counting the stars in the sky.” It is said that the venerable **Mahāgatigamiyatissadatta Thera**, desiring to venerate the Mahābodhi, was crossing to the other shore by boat, and as he sat on the upper deck of the boat, he gazed at the great ocean."

He then wondered, “Is the force of the great ocean’s waves mightier, or is the gate of method in the twenty-fourfold comprehensive Paṭṭhāna mightier?” Then he realized that there was a boundary to the great ocean: it is bounded below by the great earth, above by the sky, on one side by the Cakkavāḷa mountain, and on the other by the shoreline; but the comprehensive Paṭṭhāna has no discernible boundary. As he reflected on this exceedingly subtle Dhamma, a powerful rapture arose in him. Dispelling his rapture and developing insight, he, just as he was sitting, eradicated all defilements and became established in the highest fruit, Arahantship, and then uttered this solemn utterance: “Indeed, there is a profound, extremely difficult to comprehend,"

Then, seated on this very seat, by destroying one and a half thousand defilements, this Dhamma has been penetrated by me.’ Thus reflecting, He sat for seven days in a single cross-legged posture. Then, rising from that seat, He stood for seven days, gazing at the seat with unblinking eyes, thinking: ‘Indeed, it was on this very seat that omniscience was penetrated by me.’ Then, the thought arose in the devas: ‘Surely, Siddhattha still has some task to accomplish, for he does not abandon his attachment to the seat.’"

Indeed, the miracle performed near the Mahābodhi seat, the miracle performed at the gathering of relatives, and the miracle performed at the gathering related to Pāṭiyaputta—all were similar to the Twin Miracle performed at the foot of the Gaṇḍamba tree. Having thus performed the Twin Miracle, He descended from the sky between the place where the seat was and the place where He stood, and walked for seven days.

The Jewel House is not a mansion made of seven kinds of jewels. But it should be understood that the place where the seven Abhidhamma treatises were contemplated is called the Jewel House. Even while contemplating the Dhammasaṅgaṇī there, rays did not emanate from His body. Even while contemplating the Vibhaṅga, Dhātukathā, Puggalapaññatti, Kathāvatthu, and Yamaka treatises, no rays emanated from His body. However, when He descended to the Great Treatise (Mahāpakaraṇa) and began contemplating, ""Condition of Root (Hetupaccayo), Condition of Object (Ārammaṇapaccayo)... and so on... Condition of Non-Disappearance (Avigatapaccayo),"" then His omniscience completely found its scope only within the Great Treatise while He was contemplating the twenty-four universal Paṭṭhāna conditions.

For Buddhas, the bhavanga continuum is swift, the lips touch well, the mouth opens smoothly, the tongue is soft, the voice is sweet, and the words are quick to turn.

He, having observed the time for alms-round, creates a Nirmita Buddha, and determining, ""Let the Nirmita Buddha's manner of taking robes, taking the alms-bowl, speech, and deportment be of such a kind; let it preach such and such an amount of Dhamma,"" takes his alms-bowl and robes and goes to Lake Anotatta. Devas offer him a tooth-stick made of naga-vine. Having chewed it and cleansed his body in Lake Anotatta, he stands on the Manośilā rock-slab, puts on a well-dyed double undergarment, wraps himself in his robe, takes the stone alms-bowl offered by the Four Great Kings, and goes to Uttarakuru.

Having dwelt in the deva realm for one Buddha-interval, they were born in the human world at that time, and becoming delighted by the Twin Miracle (Yamakapāṭihāriya), they went forth under the elder. The elder, having taken the Dhamma as it was preached by the Teacher, preached it to them. The completion of the Perfectly Self-Enlightened One's Abhidhamma discourse and the five hundred monks' mastery of the seven Abhidhamma treatises occurred simultaneously."

Is it not proper to bring forth any other Sutta spoken by the Buddha?” “By whom was the Abhidhamma spoken?” “That was not spoken by the Buddha,” he said. “Friend, have you learned the Vinaya Piṭaka?” “No, friend, I have not learned it.” “It seems you speak thus unknowingly, due to not being a Vinaya-holder.” “Only a small part of the Vinaya, friend, have I learned.” “Even that you have learned badly; it must have been learned while sitting and dozing at the edge of the assembly; for those who ordain or give higher ordination to individuals like you incur an offense.” “For what reason?” Because even a small part of the Vinaya was learned badly; for it is said: “There is no offense for one who does not wish to criticize, saying: ‘Come now, friend, first learn a Suttanta, or verses, or the Abhidhamma, and afterwards you may learn the Vinaya.’” “Having been given permission in the Suttanta, one asks about the Abhidhamma or the Vinaya; having been given permission in the Abhidhamma, one asks about the Suttanta or the Vinaya; having been given permission in the Vinaya, one asks about the Suttanta or the Abhidhamma.” “But you do not even know this much,” and with this much, the opponent was subdued."

For there, the Dhamma-commander, **Venerable Sāriputta**, went to the Teacher to report the questions asked and answers given by each other, and when reporting Venerable Mahāmoggallāna’s answer, he said: “Here, friend Sāriputta, two bhikkhus speak on the Abhidhamma, they question each other, and having been questioned, they answer each other, and they do not falter; and their Dhamma-talk proceeds according to Dhamma. A bhikkhu of such a kind, friend Sāriputta, would adorn the Gosiṅga Sāla Grove.” The Teacher did not say that Abhidhammikas are outside of my Dispensation, but raising his neck like a golden yoke, filling his great mouth radiant like the full moon, emitting a Brahma-voice, he gave a cheer to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, saying: “Well done, well done, Sāriputta!” and then said: “As Moggallāna might correctly expound, Moggallāna is indeed a Dhamma-speaker, Sāriputta.” Indeed, only Abhidhamma bhikkhus are called Dhamma-speakers; the others, even when speaking Dhamma, are not Dhamma-speakers. Why? For when they speak Dhamma, they mix up different kamma, different vipāka, distinctions of matter and mind, and different dhammas. But Abhidhamma practitioners do not mix up different dhammas. Therefore, whether an Abhidhamma bhikkhu speaks Dhamma or not, when questioned, he will answer the problem. This one alone is called a true Dhamma-speaker. Bearing this in mind, the Teacher gave a cheer and said, “Well spoken by Moggallāna.”"

For the Buddhas, their conception is evident, their birth is evident, their enlightenment is evident, and the turning of the Dhamma-wheel is evident. The Twin Miracle (yamaka pāṭihāriya) is evident, their ascent to the divine realm (tidivakkamo) is evident, their teaching in the deva realm is evident, their descent from the deva realm (devo rohaṇaṃ) is evident. Just as it is improper and unreasonable for a Universal Monarch (cakkavattī) to steal a precious elephant or a precious horse and yoke it to a small cart to travel, or to steal a precious wheel and hang it on a straw cart to travel, or to place a gem that can illuminate for a yojana into a cotton basket and use it, is improper and unreasonable. Why? Because it is an item worthy of a king. Similarly, the Abhidhamma is not the domain of others; it is the domain of the omniscient Buddhas alone. It is a discourse to be taught by them. For the Buddhas, their conception is evident…their descent from the deva realm is evident. There is no need for an introductory discourse for the Abhidhamma, O wise one.’ Indeed, when this is said, the opponent cannot produce any counter-example based on the Dhamma."

Among these, the Teacher completely penetrated the five aggregates at the foot of the Bodhi tree; during these three months, He dwelt exclusively with the aggregate of feeling (vedanākkhandha). He completely penetrated the twelve sense bases and the eighteen elements. During these three months, He dwelt exclusively with feeling in the dhamma-sense-base and with feeling in the dhamma-element. He completely penetrated the four Noble Truths; during these three months, He dwelt exclusively with feeling as the truth of suffering. He completely penetrated the twenty-two faculties; during these three months, He dwelt exclusively with the five faculties pertaining to feeling. He completely penetrated the twelve-linked wheel of dependent origination; during these three months, He dwelt exclusively with feeling conditioned by contact. He completely penetrated the four foundations of mindfulness; during these three months, He dwelt exclusively with the foundation of mindfulness of feelings. He completely penetrated the four jhānas; during these three months, He dwelt exclusively with feeling among the jhāna factors. He completely penetrated mentality (nāma); during these three months, He dwelt exclusively with feeling within it. He completely penetrated phenomena (dhamma); during these three months, He dwelt exclusively with the triad of feeling (vedanāttika). Thus, the Elder related the nidāna of the Abhidhamma according to the Padesavihāra Suttanta."

He did not engage in any other profession but learned only the brahminical arts. While he was still young, his parents passed away. Then, his treasurer minister brought the account book of wealth, opened the treasuries filled with gold, silver, jewels, pearls, and so forth, and said: ‘Prince, this much is your mother’s property, this much is your father’s property, and this much belongs to your grandfathers and great-grandfathers,’ thus explaining the wealth up to the seventh generation of his family, and added, ‘You should take charge of this.’ Sumedha Paṇḍita thought: ‘My fathers and grandfathers, having accumulated this wealth, did not take even a single kahāpaṇa with them when they went to the other world. It is fitting that I should make a cause to take it with me.’ So, having informed the king, he had a drum beaten throughout the city, gave alms to the populace, and embraced the ascetic's life.

For one walking on a path with a stiff and uneven ground surface, the feet ache, blisters arise, the mind does not achieve one-pointedness, and meditation fails. But on a soft and level ground, meditation succeeds due to comfortable dwelling. Therefore, stiffness and unevenness of the ground surface should be understood as one fault. If there is a tree within, in the middle, or at the end of the walking path, one walking heedlessly might strike one's forehead or head; thus, a tree within is the second fault. For one walking on a walking path overgrown with grass, vines, etc., in the darkness, one might step on or kill creatures like snakes, or be bitten by them and suffer pain; thus, being overgrown and dense is the third fault. On a walking path that is too cramped, a cubit or half a cubit in width, one walking might stumble on the boundary, and one's nails or toes might break; thus, being too cramped is the fourth fault. On a walking path that is too vast, one's mind wanders and does not achieve one-pointedness; thus, being too vast is the fifth fault. However, a walking path that is one and a half cubits wide, with narrow paths of one cubit on both sides, sixty cubits long, with a soft surface and evenly spread sand, is suitable, like the walking path of the elder Mahinda, who brought joy to the island, on Cetiyagiri; such was that path. Therefore, he said, ""I made a walking path there, free from the five faults."""

Going to the end of the walking path and not seeing any footprints, he thought, ""Surely the recluses, having sought alms in the nearby village and being weary, must have come and entered the leaf-hut and are sitting there."" After waiting a short while, he thought, ""They are taking too long, I will find out."" He opened the door of the leaf-hut cell, entered inside, looked around here and there, read the inscriptions on the main wall, and thinking, ""These requisites are proper for me, I will take these and renounce,"" he discarded the pair of garments he was wearing. Therefore, it is said, ""I abandoned the garment there."" Thus, Sāriputta, having entered, I abandoned the garment in that leaf-hut."

Its difficulty in being found again is one fault; its unsuitability for the ascetic life is one fault; its being common to enemies is one fault (for it must be guarded so that enemies do not take it). Its serving as an ornament for the wearer is one fault; its being a heavy burden on the shoulder and leading to much craving for the one who carries it, is one fault."

It is said that he, taking off his excellent pair of civilian clothes, took the crimson bark-fibre robe, which hung on the robe-rack like a garland of anojā flowers, and put it on. Over it, he draped another golden-coloured bark-fibre robe. He placed a spotted deer-skin with hooves, resembling a bed of punnāga flowers, over one shoulder. He bound his matted hair, inserted a precious needle into his topknot to make it firm, placed a coral-coloured water-pot in a net-sling resembling a string of pearls, and took a curved carrying-pole (kāja) in three places. On one end of the pole, he hung the water-pot; on the other, an elephant-goad, a basket, a three-pronged staff, and so forth. Carrying the pole laden with requisites on his shoulder, and holding a walking-stick in his right hand, he left the leaf-hut. Walking back and forth on a great walking-path sixty cubits long, he surveyed his own appearance and thought, ""My aspiration has reached its peak. How beautiful is my ascetic life! This ascetic life has been praised and extolled by all wise men, including Buddhas and Paccekabuddhas. The bonds of household life have been abandoned by me. I have gone forth into renunciation. I have obtained the supreme ascetic life. I will practice the duties of an ascetic; I will attain the bliss of the highest fruits!"" Filled with enthusiasm, he put down his carrying-pole, sat on a mung-bean-coloured stone slab in the middle of the walking-path like a golden statue, and passed the day. In the evening, he entered the leaf-hut and lay down on a wooden mat beside his bamboo bed. Having accustomed his body to the climate, he awoke at dawn and reflected on his own renunciation: ""I, having seen the dangers of household life, abandoned immeasurable wealth and endless fame, entered the forest, and became an ascetic seeking Nibbāna. From now on, it is not fitting to lead a heedless life. Indeed, flies of wrong thoughts will devour one who wanders, abandoning solitude. Now it is fitting for me to cultivate solitude. I came forth having seen household life as an impediment. This pleasant leaf-hut, with its ground smooth like the colour of a bael fruit, its white walls like silver, its leaf-thatch like the colour of a pigeon's foot, and its bamboo bed adorned with varied coverings, is a comfortable dwelling place. It seems to me that my household prosperity was no more excellent than this."" Thus, investigating the faults of the leaf-hut, he perceived eight dangers."

The necessity of accumulating materials and making the hut is one drawback. The constant need for maintenance due to grass, leaves, and earth falling, and having to replace them repeatedly, is the second. A monastery is for the elder ones; if a junior monk is awakened at an untimely hour, his concentration will be disturbed—this need for being awakened by others is the third. The body becoming delicate due to protection from cold and heat is the fourth. Any evil deed can be done by one who has entered a house, thus the ability to conceal blame is the fifth. The act of appropriating it as 'mine' is the sixth. The existence of a house is like having a second companion—this is the seventh. Its commonness due to sharing with lice, bugs, house-lizards, and so forth is the eighth. Having seen these eight drawbacks, the Great Being renounced the leaf-hut. Therefore, it is said, ""I renounced the leaf-hut, which was fraught with eight dangers."""

Little maintenance is the second, for whether it is swept or unswept, it is always suitable for use. The absence of being awakened by others is the third; it does not conceal blame, for one who commits evil there is ashamed, thus the inability to conceal blame is the fourth. It does not make the body firm, like living in the open air, thus the non-stiffening of the body is the fifth. The absence of appropriation is the sixth; the rejection of attachment to a dwelling is the seventh; the absence of driving out others, as in a house shared by many, saying, ""I will maintain it, you all leave,"" is the eighth; the delight of the dweller is the ninth; and its being easily available wherever one goes, due to the abundance of tree-root dwellings, and thus the absence of attachment to it, is the tenth. Having seen these ten qualities, he says, ""I went to the foot of a tree."""
