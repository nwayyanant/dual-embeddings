Therein, the **Majjhima Saṅgīti** is a collection of three fifties: the Root Fifty, the Middle Fifty, and the Upper Fifty. By way of divisions, with five divisions in each fifty, it comprises fifteen divisions. By way of suttas, it is one hundred and fifty suttas and two suttantas. By way of words, it is eighty thousand words, with an additional five hundred and twenty-three words. Therefore the ancients said:"

By way of connections, there are briefly three kinds of connections: by way of question, by way of intention, and as it occurs. In detail, there are three thousand nine hundred connections herein. Therefore the ancients said:"
s0201a.att,43,"‘‘Tīṇi  sandhisahassāni, tathā navasatāni ca;","“Three thousand connections, and likewise nine hundred;"

Of that too, the introduction beginning “Thus have I heard,” spoken by the venerable Ānanda at the time of the First Great Council, is the beginning. And that First Great Council is detailed at the beginning of the Sumaṅgalavilāsinī, the commentary on the Dīgha Nikāya. Therefore, it should be understood according to the method detailed there."

Now, regarding this introduction beginning “Thus have I heard.” Therein, **evaṃ** is a particle. Words such as **me** are nouns.

Svāyamidha ākāranidassanāvadhāraṇesu daṭṭhabbo.","In terms of meaning, however, the word **evaṃ** has many different meanings, such as simile, instruction, praise, censure, acceptance of speech, manner, demonstration, and affirmation. For instance, it appears in simile in passages like “Thus by a mortal who is born should much merit be done.” In instruction, in passages like “Thus you should go forward, thus you should go back.” In praise, in passages like “So it is, Blessed One, so it is, Sugata.” In censure, in passages like “In this very way, this outcast praises that shaven-headed ascetic in any and every way.” In acceptance of speech, in passages like “Those bhikkhus replied to the Blessed One, saying, ‘Yes, venerable sir.’” In manner, in passages like “In this manner, venerable sir, I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One.” In demonstration, in passages like “Come, young man, go to the ascetic Ānanda and, on my behalf, ask the ascetic Ānanda about his freedom from illness and affliction, his lightness, strength, and comfortable living, saying: ‘The young man Subha, son of Todeyya, asks the venerable Ānanda about his freedom from illness and affliction, his lightness, strength, and comfortable living,’ and say this: ‘It would be good if the venerable Ānanda would go to the residence of the young man Subha, son of Todeyya, out of compassion.’” “What do you think, Kālāmas, are these things wholesome or unwholesome? Unwholesome, venerable sir. Are they blameworthy or blameless? Blameworthy, venerable sir. Are they censured by the wise or praised by the wise? Censured by the wise, venerable sir. When undertaken and observed, do they lead to harm and suffering, or not, or what is your opinion on this matter? When undertaken and observed, venerable sir, they lead to harm and suffering; this is our opinion on this matter.” In these and similar passages, it is in affirmation. Here, it should be seen in the senses of manner, demonstration, and affirmation."

But, having generated the desire to hear with all one’s might, it is thus: “Thus it was heard by me,” and “I too have heard it in one way.”"

For, in such phrases as, “Food obtained by reciting verses is not to be eaten by me,” its meaning is ‘by me’. In such phrases as, “Venerable sir, may the Blessed One teach me the Dhamma in brief,” its meaning is ‘to me’. In such phrases as, “Monks, be heirs to my Dhamma,” its meaning is ‘my’. Here, however, it is suitable in the two senses of “heard by me” and “my hearing.”"

For, in such phrases as, “Gone forth with the army,” its meaning is ‘going’. In such phrases as, “Of one who sees the renowned Dhamma,” its meaning is ‘renowned Dhamma’; in such phrases as, “The moistened for the moistened,” its meaning is ‘the stained for the stained’. In such phrases as, “Much merit has been accumulated by you,” its meaning is ‘accumulated’. In such phrases as, “Those wise ones who are applied to jhāna,” its meaning is ‘devoted to jhāna’. In such phrases as, “Seen, heard, sensed,” its meaning is ‘cognizable by the ear’. In such phrases as, “A bearer of what is heard, a collector of what is heard,” its meaning is ‘a bearer of what is known by following the ear-door’. Here, however, its meaning is ‘retained’ or ‘retention’ by way of following the ear-door. For, when the word ‘me’ has the meaning of ‘by me,’ it is fitting as, “Thus it was heard, retained by me by following the ear-door.” When it has the meaning of ‘my,’ it is fitting as, “Thus is my hearing, my retention by following the ear-door.”"

Likewise, **evaṃ** is the declaration of the state of occurrence in the object in various ways of that cognitive process which has arisen by following the ear-door. **Me** is the declaration of the self. **Suta** is the declaration of the Dhamma. And here, this is the summary: “By means of the cognitive process that has occurred in the object in various ways, nothing else was done by me, but this was done: this Dhamma was heard.”"

By this much, the determination of grasping is made in the domain of the agent who is endowed with that mental continuum occurring in various ways."

Herein, this is the summary: “It was heard by me, the person endowed with the function of hearing and with consciousness, who has obtained the designation of ‘the function of hearing’ by way of consciousness.”"

For what is there in the ultimate sense that would receive the designation of ‘evaṃ’ or ‘me’? **Suta** is a concept of what does exist. For that which is apprehended by the ear here exists in the ultimate sense."

And herein, by the word **evaṃ**, he shows non-delusion. For a deluded person is not capable of penetrating in various ways. By the word **suta**, he shows non-forgetfulness of what was heard. For one whose hearing has been forgotten does not, after a time, profess, “It was heard by me.” Thus, for him, the accomplishment of wisdom is through non-delusion, while the accomplishment of mindfulness is through non-forgetfulness. Therein, with mindfulness preceded by wisdom, there is the ability to retain the phrasing; with wisdom preceded by mindfulness, there is the ability to penetrate the meaning. Through the connection with the ability in both, and due to the ability to preserve the treasury of the Dhamma, which is complete in meaning and phrasing, there is the accomplishment of being the Treasurer of the Dhamma."

By the word **suta**, he shows non-distraction, because one with a distracted mind is unable to hear. Indeed, a person with a distracted mind, even when spoken to with all completeness, says, “It was not heard by me, please speak again.” Herein, by wise attention, he establishes right aspiration of the self and merit made in the past, because these are absent for one whose self is wrongly directed or who has not made merit in the past. And by non-distraction, he establishes the hearing of the true Dhamma and resorting to good persons. For a distracted person is not able to hear, and for one who does not attend upon good persons, there is no hearing."

And since such a good mode does not occur for one whose self is not rightly directed or for one who has not made merit in the past, therefore, by “thus,” with this good mode, he indicates his own accomplishment in the latter pair of wheels; by “heard,” through the application of hearing, the accomplishment in the former pair of wheels. For there is no hearing for one who lives in an unsuitable place or who is without the support of true persons. Thus, through his accomplishment in the latter pair of wheels, the purity of his intention is accomplished. Through the accomplishment in the former pair of wheels, the purity of his application. And by that purity of intention, there is accomplishment in the skill of realization; by the purity of application, there is accomplishment in the skill of the scriptures. Thus, the speech of one whose application and intention are pure, who is accomplished in the scriptures and realization, is worthy of being the forerunner of the Blessed One's speech, just as the dawn is for the rising of the sun, and just as wise attention is for wholesome karma. Therefore, placing the introduction in its proper context, he said, “Thus have I heard,” and so on."

By this word “heard,” which indicates the penetration of the various kinds of things to be heard, the existence of his accomplishment in the analytical knowledge of the Dhamma and language. And in speaking this word “thus,” which indicates wise attention, he indicates, “These dhammas have been contemplated by me with the mind, well-penetrated with vision.” In speaking this word “heard,” which indicates the application of hearing, he indicates, “Many dhammas have been heard by me, borne in mind, and practiced with speech.” By both of these, while indicating the completeness of the meaning and the letter, he generates reverence for hearing. For one who does not listen with reverence to the Dhamma that is complete in meaning and letter is excluded from great benefit; thus, having generated reverence, the Dhamma should be listened to attentively."

Similarly, he raises his mind from the false Dhamma; he establishes his mind in the true Dhamma. By indicating, “This was merely heard by me, it is the word of that Blessed One himself,” he absolves himself, points to the Teacher, establishes it as the Victor's word, and establishes the guideline of the Dhamma."

There should be no doubt or uncertainty here regarding the meaning, the Dhamma, the phrase, or the letter.” Thus, for all devas and humans, he dispels faithlessness in this Dhamma and produces the accomplishment of faith.

For there, in the Abhidhamma and in other sutta passages, the meaning of location and the meaning of *bhāvena-bhāvalakkhaṇa* are possible. Indeed, the time (samayo) has the meaning of a temporal point and the meaning of a collection; it is the basis for the dhammas such as contact, etc., mentioned there, and their existence is indicated by the existence of that time, which is designated as the moment, the conjunction, and the cause.

And by the former, the application to teaching the Dhamma; by the latter, the inclination towards seclusion. By the former, approaching through compassion; by the latter, departing through wisdom. By the former, the resolve to accomplish the welfare and happiness of beings; by the latter, being unstained in the act of bringing about the welfare and happiness of others. By the former, a comfortable abiding as a sign of not abandoning righteous happiness; by the latter, as a sign of practicing the higher human states.

Who is that one person? The Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One”; by the latter, abiding in a way appropriate to where he arose. For the Blessed One arose in a forest, first in the Lumbinī grove, second at the seat of Awakening, through his mundane and supramundane arising; therefore, he shows his abiding in a forest.

Furthermore, here the meaning of the word should be understood according to the method of, ""He is a bhikkhu because he begs; he is a bhikkhu because he has undertaken the practice of alms-gathering,"" and so on. **Āmantesi** means here that he addressed, he spoke, he made them understand. Elsewhere, however, it is also used in the sense of informing. As was said: ""I inform you, bhikkhus; I declare to you, bhikkhus."" Also in the sense of summoning.

For one who is endowed with the quality of being habitually mendicant is also a **bhikkhu**; one who is endowed with the quality of the nature of mendicancy also. Also one endowed with the quality of performing well in mendicancy, so the grammarians think. And by that term, which is established through their connection with the qualities of being habitually mendicant and so on, by revealing a livelihood followed by inferior and superior people, he suppresses the state of being arrogant and dejected. And with this word ""Bhikkhavo,"" which is preceded by a gaze of the eyes from a serene heart suffused with compassion, he makes them turn their faces toward him. And with that very word, which indicates the desire to speak, he generates in them the desire to listen. And with that same word, which has the meaning of addressing, he also enjoins them to careful listening and attention. For the attainment of the Dispensation is dependent on careful listening and attention."

They are the best, because, beginning with the state of homelessness, they follow the teacher’s conduct and are the recipients of the entire Dispensation. They are near, because among those seated there, they are in the Teacher's presence. They are always present, because they frequent the Teacher's presence. Moreover, they are vessels for the teaching of the Dhamma, because of the existence of the practice as instructed.

For the purpose of arousing mindfulness. For bhikkhus may be sitting while thinking of something else, with distracted minds, reflecting on the Dhamma, or attending to a meditation subject. If the Dhamma were taught without addressing them, being unable to determine, ""What is the reason for this teaching, what is its cause, due to what occasion was it taught?"" they might either grasp it wrongly or not grasp it at all. Therefore, for the purpose of arousing mindfulness in them, the Blessed One first addresses them and then teaches the Dhamma."

With ""Bhikkhus,"" he prompts a response; with ""Bhadante,"" they give a response. **Those bhikkhus** means those whom the Blessed One addressed. **They responded to the Blessed One** means they replied to the Blessed One’s address; the meaning is that they, having turned their attention, listened, assented, and accepted. **The Blessed One said this** means the Blessed One spoke this entire sutta that is now to be spoken."

It is said that five hundred brahmins, masters of the three Vedas, later heard the Blessed One’s teaching of the Dhamma. Seeing the danger in sensual pleasures and the benefit in renunciation, they went forth in the presence of the Blessed One. Before long, having mastered the entire word of the Buddha, they developed conceit based on their scriptural learning, thinking, ""Whatever the Blessed One says, we understand it quickly. The Blessed One says nothing beyond the three genders, four types of words, and seven cases, and when he speaks thus, there is no difficult term for us."" Becoming disrespectful toward the Blessed One, from then on they did not regularly go to attend upon the Blessed One or to listen to the Dhamma. The Blessed One, knowing the state of their minds, thought, ""These men are incapable of realizing the path or the fruit without having destroyed this stake of conceit."" Making the conceit that arose in them dependent on their learning from the scriptures the particular reason, the Blessed One, skilled in teaching, began the discourse **""The Root of All Dhammas""** in order to shatter their conceit."

Therefore, even though seeing them with the eye, one who does not see with knowledge the characteristic of impermanence, etc., seen by the noble ones, and who does not realize the Dhamma realized by the noble ones, should be understood as ""one who has not seen the noble ones"" because of not having seen the dhammas that make one noble and the state of nobility itself."

Among these, **earth as a characteristic** is that which is mentioned in texts such as, ""And what, friends, is the internal earth element? That which is internal, personal, hard, and solid."" **Earth with its components** is that which is mentioned in texts such as, ""Should he dig the earth or have it dug.""

The **earth element with its components** is what is spoken of in such passages as: ""Should one dig the earth or cause it to be dug."" And this also includes the twenty parts such as head hair, and external things such as iron and copper.

All of these are applicable here.

Or, while not abandoning the earth-aspect, he perceives it in a way such as 'it is a being' or 'it belongs to a being'.  It should not be asked why he perceives thus.  For a worldling is like a madman.  He grasps anything in any way whatsoever.  Or, the very fact of not having seen the Noble Ones, and so on, is the reason here.

For, by the thorough penetration of a certain Dhamma-element, one is endowed with the elegant style of a teaching that is varied with numerous methods; this has been thoroughly penetrated by the Blessed One. Therefore, having previously shown the arising of defilements by way of conceiving, He now says this either due to the elegance of the teaching, showing it by way of delighting, or, whoever conceives earth, conceives in earth, conceives from earth, conceives 'earth is mine,' because he is unable to abandon the craving or view dependent on earth, he therefore delights in earth. And whoever delights in earth, delights in suffering, and suffering is a danger; thus, He also said this to show the danger.

By means of that, since when the four great elements are grasped, derived materiality is also grasped, because it does not transcend the characteristic of materiality. And that which is the primary elements and derived materiality is the materiality aggregate. Therefore, by saying, ""the uninstructed ordinary person conceives earth, water, fire, wind,"" it is also said in meaning that he observes materiality as self. By saying, ""he conceives in earth, in water, in fire, in wind,"" it is also said that he observes the self in materiality. By saying, ""he conceives from earth, from water, from fire, from wind,"" since it is established that the self is other than materiality, it is also said that he observes the self as possessing materiality or materiality in the self. Thus, these four conceivings of identity-view having materiality as their object should be understood. Therein, one is the annihilationist view, and three are eternalist views; thus there are only two views. This specific meaning should also be understood."

Therein, this word **bhūta** is seen in the contexts of the five aggregates, non-human beings, elements, what is existent, the arahant, beings, trees, and so on. For in passages such as, “Monks, you should observe this as having come into being,” it is seen in the sense of the five aggregates. In, “Whatever beings have gathered here,” it is in the sense of non-human beings. In, “Monk, these four great elements are the cause,” it is in the sense of elements. In passages such as, “A *pācittiya* offense for what is factual,” it is in the sense of what is existent. In, “The one who, having come into being, consumes time,” it is in the sense of an arahant. In, “All beings in the world will lay down the body,” it is in the sense of beings. In, “For damaging a plant,” it is in the sense of trees and so on.

This person, in the way stated, ""he sees a householder or a householder's son, endowed and furnished with the five cords of sensual pleasure,"" takes beings to be beautiful and happy and becomes impassioned. And he becomes impassioned upon seeing them, upon hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, or knowing them. Thus he conceives beings with the conceiving of craving. Or else, in the way of, “Oh, that I might be reborn in the company of wealthy khattiyas,” and so on, he directs his mind to attaining what has not been attained. In this way too he conceives beings with the conceiving of craving. Relying on his own and beings' fortune and misfortune, he places himself as superior. And among beings, some being is inferior, or he himself is inferior, and some being is superior. Or he places himself as equal to a being, or a being as equal to himself. As it is said: ""Here, someone, on the basis of birth... or some other thing, in a former time places himself as equal to others. In a later time, he places himself as superior. He places others as inferior. Whatever conceit of this sort... this is called conceit and excessive conceit."" Thus he conceives beings with the conceiving of conceit."

Thus the Blessed One, having shown the devalokas in sequence and having shown the sphere of non-percipient beings by the word Abhibhū, now—because this is a discourse on the cycle of rebirth, and the Suddhāvāsas stand on the side of that which escapes the cycle, for those devas are exclusively non-returners and arahants. Or because those devas have a lifespan of only several thousand kappas and exist only during the time of a Buddha's appearance. But Buddhas do not arise even for an incalculable number of kappas, and at that time, that plane is empty. For the Suddhāvāsa sphere is like a king's encampment for the Buddhas. And for that very reason, they are not included in the stations of consciousness or the abodes of beings; but these conceivings are perennial. Therefore, showing their ever-existing plane, having passed beyond the Suddhāvāsa realms, he said, **'the base of infinite space'**, and so on. Therein, **'the base of infinite space'** refers to the four wholesome, resultant, and functional aggregates belonging to that plane. And they should be seen as belonging only to those reborn there, because this is a discourse defining the planes of existence. This is the method for **'the base of infinite consciousness'** and so on. The application of meaning in all four of these sections, however, should be understood in the way stated in the section on Abhibhū.

Therein, **'conceives the seen'** means one conceives the seen through the three kinds of conceiving. How? Perceiving the visible-form base with a perception of beauty and a perception of pleasure, one generates sensual desire for it, savors it, and delights in it. For this was said by the Blessed One: ""Monks, beings are impassioned, greedy, infatuated, besotted, and attached to the form of a woman; following the sway of a woman's form, they grieve for a long time."" In this way, one conceives the seen through the conceiving of craving. Or one brings delight to it, thinking, ""May such be my form in the future,"" or desiring perfection of form, one gives alms—this is the detailed explanation. In this way too, one conceives the seen through the conceiving of craving. Furthermore, depending on the perfection or imperfection of one's own or another's form, one generates conceit. ""By this I am superior,"" or ""I am equal,"" or ""I am inferior""—in this way, one conceives the seen through the conceiving of conceit. Moreover, one conceives the visible-form base as permanent, stable, and eternal; one conceives it as self or what belongs to self; one conceives something as auspicious or inauspicious—in this way, one conceives the seen through the conceiving of views. Thus one conceives the seen through the three kinds of conceiving. How does one conceive *in* the seen? One conceives in the seen by conceiving in the manner of contemplating self in form. Or it is like in the case of wealth and grain. In this way, one who conceives ""in form, there are lust and so on"" also conceives in the seen. This is one's conceiving of views.

One who has destroyed the corruptions (khīṇāsava), since they are abandoned, is called one who ""does not conceive.""

Indeed, the learner (`sekha`) is similar to one whose cankers are destroyed due to being a noble person (`ariyapuggala`); by this, the similarity of persons is obtained. The similarity of objects, however, is just as has been explained. **Arahant** means one for whom the defilements are far (`āraka-kileso`), one for whom the defilements are distant (`dūra-kileso`), one whose defilements are abandoned.

For him, evil, unwholesome states—defiling, leading to renewed existence, troublesome, resulting in suffering, and leading in the future to birth, aging, and death—are far away (`ārakā`). It is in this way, monks, that a bhikkhu is an arahant."" **One whose cankers are destroyed (`khīṇāsavo`)**: The four cankers are the canker of sensual pleasure... and so on... the canker of ignorance. For the arahant, these four cankers are destroyed, abandoned, cut off at the root, pacified, rendered incapable of arising, and burned by the fire of knowledge. Therefore, he is called 'one whose cankers are destroyed'."

Here, the letter 'k' has been changed to 'd'. And by `sadattha`, arahantship should be understood. For that, because of its nature of being connected to oneself, of not abandoning oneself, and being one's own ultimate goal, is called 'one's own goal' (`sak'attha`)."

Having rightly known as it really is—the meaning of the aggregates as aggregates, the meaning of the sense bases as sense bases, the meaning of the elements as elements; the oppressive meaning of suffering, the originating meaning of the origin, the peaceful meaning of cessation, the seeing meaning of the path; or the distinction that 'all formations are impermanent', and so on—having known, discerned, weighed, made manifest, and clarified it."

The arahant, because his mind is liberated from all defilements, is liberated by the liberation of the mind. Because he is intent on Nibbāna, he is liberated in Nibbāna. Therefore, he is called 'rightly liberated through final knowledge'. **It has been fully understood by him** means: For that arahant, that object of conceiving has been fully understood by the three kinds of full understanding (`pariññā`). Therefore, it is said that he does not conceive that object, or he does not conceive that conceiving. The rest is in accordance with the method already stated."

They should also be elaborated in the sections on earth and so on. And this section on full understanding should also be elaborated in the section on Nibbāna. And when elaborating, after connecting ""it has been fully understood by him"" with all the terms, it should then be connected with ""through the destruction of lust, being free from lust"". This is the method in the other cases as well. The teaching, however, is abbreviated, because what is stated in one place is indeed stated everywhere."

An arahant, however, is free from lust precisely through its destruction. Therefore it is said, ""through the destruction of lust, being free from lust"". This same method applies to hatred and delusion. And just as when it is said, ""I say, 'It has been fully understood by him',"" the meaning is that because it has been fully understood, he does not conceive that object or that conceiving, so too here it should be understood that because he is free from lust, he does not conceive that object or that conceiving."

The others, however, should be understood as being stated to show the completion of the realization of the fruit. Alternatively, an arahant does not conceive for two reasons: because the object has been fully understood and because the unwholesome roots have been cut off. Therefore, by the section on full understanding, he indicates the full understanding of the object, and by the others, the cutting off of the unwholesome roots. Therein, in the last three sections, this distinction should be understood: in the three sections, one who, seeing the danger in lust, dwells contemplating suffering, is liberated by the desireless liberation (`appaṇihita-vimokkha`) and becomes free from lust through the destruction of lust. One who, seeing the danger in hatred, dwells contemplating impermanence, is liberated by the signless liberation (`animitta-vimokkha`) and becomes free from hatred through the destruction of hatred. One who, seeing the danger in delusion, dwells contemplating not-self, is liberated by the emptiness liberation (`suññata-vimokkha`) and becomes free from delusion through the destruction of delusion."

Because of having fully understood the suffering of formations (*saṅkhāra-dukkha*), he is called ‘freed from delusion through the destruction of delusion’. Or, because of having fully understood a desirable object, he is ‘freed from lust through the destruction of lust’. Because of having fully understood an undesirable object, he is ‘freed from aversion through the destruction of aversion’. Because of having fully understood a neutral object, he is ‘freed from delusion through the destruction of delusion’. Or, because the underlying tendency to lust has been utterly cut off in regard to pleasant feeling, he is ‘freed from lust through the destruction of lust’; and because the underlying tendencies to aversion and delusion have been utterly cut off in regard to the other feelings, he is ‘freed from aversion’ and ‘freed from delusion’. Therefore, to show that distinction, he said, “because of being freed from lust through the destruction of lust… and so on… because of being freed from delusion.”"

There is not even a hair’s breadth of error in it. All of it is just so, unerring, as if sealed with a single seal, measured with a single measuring vessel, or weighed with a single scale. Therefore, he said: “Cunda, on the night the Tathāgata fully awakens to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment, and on the night he attains final Nibbāna with the Nibbāna-element that has no remainder of clinging, whatever he speaks, utters, and explains in the interim, all of it is just so and not otherwise. Therefore, he is called the Tathāgata.” Here, the word *gata* has the meaning of ‘spoken’ (*gada*). Thus, he is the Tathāgata due to speaking what is true. Moreover, *āgadana* means *āgada*, which means ‘speech’. His speech (*āgada*) is true (*tatha*), not distorted. Thus, by changing the letter ‘d’ to ‘t’, the term ‘Tathāgata’ is formed.

He is the Tathāgata because he has gone beyond (*gato*) the origin of the world with the true (*tathāya*) full understanding by abandoning. He is the Tathāgata because he has attained (*gato*) the cessation of the world with the true (*tathāya*) realization.

Although for the Buddhas, there is no difference from their disciples in the abandoning of defilements by means of the various paths, there is, however, a difference in their full understanding. For the disciples attain Nibbāna by contemplating just one portion of the four elements. But for the Buddhas, there is not even the slightest amount of conditioned phenomena that has not been seen, weighed, examined, and realized by their knowledge."

Since they are born, they are called ""birth."" Or this teaching is given with birth as the main point. This too should be connected with ""having known thus."" For this is the meaning here: ""And having known thus that from kamma-becoming, rebirth-becoming arises."" **Of what has come to be** means of a being. **Aging and death** means aging and death. This is what is said: And having known thus that for a being that has come to be through that rebirth-becoming, there is aging and death of the aggregates."

Furthermore, the interval between craving and suffering is one connection; the interval between suffering and becoming is the second; the interval between becoming and birth is the third. In this way, the three connections between the four summaries, which are like the spaces between four fingers, should be understood."

For whatever craving is destroyed, it is also faded away, ceased, given up, and relinquished. Or, **through the destruction** is common to the function of all four paths. Therefore, it should be connected thus: **fading away** through the first path, **cessation** through the second, **giving up** through the third, **relinquishment** through the fourth. Or, through the destruction of those cravings by which one would perceive earth as earth. Through the fading away of those by which one would conceive earth. Through the cessation of those by which one would conceive in earth. Through the giving up of those by which one would conceive from earth. Through the relinquishment of those by which one would conceive 'earth is mine'. Or, through the destruction of those by which one would conceive earth... and so on... through the relinquishment of those by which one would delight in earth.

For Paccekabuddhas, it gives only the knowledge of a Paccekabodhi.

Because he has understood it thus: “Delight is the root of suffering, from existence comes birth, for one who has come to be there is aging and death.” Therein, in **iti viditvā**, the word **iti** has the meaning of a cause. By that, it is said: “because of having known this dependent origination, because of having penetrated it.” Furthermore, because, having thus understood this dependent origination, the craving which is called ‘delight’ has been abandoned in all its aspects for the Tathāgata, and because the Tathāgata, through the complete destruction of all those cravings… and so on… has fully awakened to the supreme, perfect enlightenment. Therefore, I declare that he does not conceive the earth… and so on… does not delight in the earth.

Those five hundred monks did not approve of this word of the Blessed One. Why? Due to not knowing. It is said that they did not know the meaning of this sutta; therefore, they did not delight in it. Indeed, at that time, this sutta, though endowed with the elegance of a teaching with such various methods, was for them like delicious food placed before them after their faces had been bound with a thick, heavy cloth. But did not the Blessed One, in order to make others know the Dhamma he taught, attain omniscience after fulfilling the perfections for four incalculables and a hundred thousand aeons? So why did he teach in a way that they would not understand? It was already stated in the exposition on the delivery of this sutta: “He began the discourse on the Root of All Things in order to crush conceit.” Therefore, there is nothing more to be said here. Hearing this sutta, which was taught to crush conceit, those monks thought: “Indeed, that very earth is perceived by one with wrong views, by the learner, by the arahant, and by the Tathāgata. What is this? What sort of thing is this?” And reflecting, “Previously, we quickly understood whatever the Blessed One said, but now we do not know or see the beginning or the end of this Root Discourse. Oh, Buddhas are truly immeasurable, incomparable!” they became free from intoxication, like snakes with their fangs removed, and approached the Buddha's presence and the hearing of the Dhamma with reverence."

Then the Blessed One, having come out of the perfumed chamber, by a miracle appropriate to that moment, sat down on the excellent Buddha-seat prepared in the Dhamma hall and said to those monks, “For what talk, monks, are you now gathered together?” They related the matter to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this: “Not just now, monks, but in the past too, I crushed the conceit of these very ones who were wandering with their heads held high in pride.” Then, on account of this origin story, he related this past event:"

He taught the sacred texts to five hundred young men. The wise young men learned a great deal and learned it quickly, and they paid close attention. And what they had learned was not lost to them. That brahmin, too, without keeping a “teacher's fist,” had them learn all the skills, just like pouring water into a pot, and then said this to those young men: “This much is the skill that is for the welfare of this life and the next.” Those young men, thinking, “What our teacher knows, we also know. Now we too are teachers,” generated conceit and from then on lived disrespectfully towards their teacher, having abandoned their duties. The teacher, knowing this, thought, “I will crush their conceit.” So one day, he said to those young men who had come to attend on him, and were seated after paying homage, “My dears, I will ask a question. Are you able to answer it?” As might be expected of those intoxicated with the pride of learning, they immediately said, “Ask, teacher, ask, teacher!” The teacher said:"

For time does not eat the skin, flesh, etc., of beings, but rather, by depleting their lifespan, beauty, and strength, by crushing their youth, and by destroying their health, it is said to **devour** and eat them. **All, including itself**: And in devouring thus, it does not leave anything out; it devours all without exception. And not only beings, but it also devours itself along with them. For the forenoon-time does not reach the afternoon-time. This same principle applies to the afternoon-time and so on. **And that being who devours time** is a designation for one whose taints are destroyed. For he, having exhausted and consumed the time for future rebirth-linking, is called one who “devours time.” **He has cooked the cooker of beings**: That is, the craving which cooks beings in the states of loss—he has cooked it, burned it, and reduced it to ash with the fire of knowledge. Therefore, he is called one who “has cooked the cooker of beings.” There is also the reading “pajaniṃ.” The meaning is that which generates or produces."

Jeta’s Grove is the grove of Jeta. For it was planted, nurtured, and protected by Prince Jeta, and he was its owner. Therefore, it is called Jeta’s Grove. In that **Jeta’s Grove**. **In Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery**: Here, that householder was named Sudatta by his parents. However, due to his abundance of all desirable things, his freedom from the stain of stinginess, and his possession of virtues such as compassion, he constantly gave alms to the destitute; thus he became known as Anāthapiṇḍika. Beings, or especially the ordained, delight (āramanti) here, thus it is a monastery (ārāma). Because of the beauty of its flowers, fruits, and so on, and its possession of the five qualities of a dwelling place, such as being not too far and not too near, people come from all around and delight (ramanti), take great delight (abhiramanti), and live there without dissatisfaction. Or, due to its aforementioned qualities, it draws in and delights even those who have gone elsewhere, thus it is a monastery (ārāma). For it was purchased by the householder Anāthapiṇḍika from Prince Jeta for eighteen crores of gold coins, covering the ground with them, had dwellings built for another eighteen crores of gold coins, and completed the monastery dedication ceremony for a further eighteen crores of gold coins. Thus, with an expenditure of fifty-four crores of gold coins, it was dedicated to the Saṅgha with the Buddha at its head. Therefore, it is called “Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.” In that **Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery**. Here, the phrase “in Jeta’s Grove” is a declaration of the former owner."

For in this case, the eighteen crores of gold coins received from the sale of the land for the gatehouses and mansions, and the trees worth many crores, were Jeta’s contribution. The fifty-four crores were Anāthapiṇḍika’s. In this regard, eighteen crores of gold coins received from the sale of the land for measuring the gateway and mansion, and trees worth many crores, were the donation of Jeta; fifty-four crores were from Anāthapiṇḍika.

To show the practice for the destruction of the cankers, beginning with the purification of those monks' defilements. Therein, **the discourse on the restraint of all cankers** means the cause of restraint, the causal condition that is restraint for all cankers; the cause by which they, being restrained and closed off, go to destruction—termed non-arising and cessation—are abandoned, and do not proceed. That is the meaning. Therein, they flow, thus they are **cankers**; it is said that they seep and proceed from the eye... and so on... from the mind. Or, they are cankers because they flow up to the gotrabhū regarding dhammas, and up to the bhavagga regarding realms; the meaning is that they proceed by including these dhammas and this realm within. For this ‘ā’ has the meaning of including within. They are also cankers in the sense of being like fermented liquors and so on, due to being long-matured. In the world, long-matured fermented liquors and so on are called cankers. And if they are cankers in the sense of being long-matured, it is fitting that these very things should be so. For this has been said: ""Monks, the prior point of ignorance is not discerned, (thinking) 'Before this, there was no ignorance',"" and so on. Or, they are also cankers because they flow out, they produce the long suffering of saṃsāra. Among these, the former etymologies are appropriate wherever defilements are called cankers; the latter is also appropriate for kamma. Not only kamma and defilements are cankers, but also various kinds of calamities. For in the suttas, in the passage, ""Cunda, I do not teach the Dhamma for the restraint of cankers only in the present life,"" the defilements that are the root of disputes are referred to as cankers."

And in other suttas and in the Abhidhamma, these same three, together with the canker of views, appear in a fourfold way. In the Nibbedhika Sutta, they appear in a fivefold way: ""Monks, there are cankers that lead to hell, there are cankers that lead to the animal realm, there are cankers that lead to the sphere of spirits, there are cankers that lead to the human world, there are cankers that lead to the divine world."" In the Book of the Sixes, they appear in a sixfold way, by the method beginning, ""Monks, there are cankers to be abandoned by restraint.""

This restraint is of five kinds: restraint by virtue, restraint by mindfulness, by knowledge, by patience, and by energy. Therein, ""endowed with this Pātimokkha restraint"" refers to restraint by virtue. For here Pātimokkha virtue is called restraint. In passages beginning, ""He practices restraint over the eye faculty,"" it is restraint by mindfulness. For here mindfulness is called restraint. ""I speak of the restraint of the streams; they are closed off by wisdom""—this is restraint by knowledge. For here knowledge is called restraint in the sense of closing off, with the words ""they are closed off."" But the restraints of patience and energy are mentioned right here in this sutta by the method beginning, ""He is patient with cold... and so on..., he does not tolerate an arisen thought of sensuality.""

Therein, the restraints of patience and energy have just been mentioned. ""He avoids that which is an unsuitable seat and that which is an unsuitable resort""—this here is restraint by virtue. ""Reflecting wisely, he dwells restrained with the restraint of the eye faculty""—this is restraint by mindfulness. In all cases, reflection is restraint by knowledge. Moreover, by taking up what has not been taken up, vision, using, and development are also restraint by knowledge. Dhammas go by way of this, thus it is a 'discourse' (pariyāya); it is said that they go towards arising or towards cessation. With this much, what should be said regarding ""the discourse on the restraint of all cankers"" has been said."

Now, in the passage beginning, **""For one who knows, I say,""** **for one who knows** means for one knowing. **For one who sees** means for one seeing. Both terms have the same meaning; only the expression is different. Even so, 'for one who knows' indicates the person by reference to the characteristic of knowledge, for knowledge has the characteristic of knowing. 'For one who sees' indicates the person by reference to the power of knowledge, for knowledge has the power of seeing. A person endowed with knowledge sees the unveiled dhammas with knowledge, just as a sighted person sees forms with the eye. Furthermore, the essential meaning here is: for one who knows how to arouse wise attention, and sees in such a way that unwise attention does not arise.

Alternatively, by the former pair of words the method is stated, and by this latter pair, the non-method is rejected.

Indeed, some bhikkhu who is of an intelligent nature knows how to make an umbrella, another knows how to do something with robes and so forth. It should not be said that for one who, established at the head of his duties, does such work, that knowing is not a basis for the path and its fruit. But as for one who, having gone forth in the dispensation, knows how to practice medicine and so on, for one who knows in this way, the āsavas only increase. Therefore, to show precisely what it is that, for one who knows and sees, the destruction of the āsavas occurs, he said, **“Wise attention and unwise attention.”**"

For the entire sutta that follows is spoken in terms of the round of existence (vaṭṭa) and the ending of the round (vivaṭṭa). And the round of existence is rooted in unwise attention, while the ending of the round is rooted in wise attention. How so? Unwise attention, as it increases, brings to fulfillment two things: ignorance and craving for becoming. When there is ignorance, “with ignorance as condition, formations come to be… thus is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.” When there is craving, “with craving as condition, clinging comes to be… thus is the origin.” In this way, a person who is full of unwise attention revolves and turns back and forth again and again through states of being, births, destinies, stations of consciousness, and abodes of beings, like a wrecked ship struck by the force of the wind, like a herd of cattle fallen into a whirlpool in the Ganges, and like an ox yoked to a grinding machine. Thus, for now, is the round of existence rooted in unwise attention."

Thus, with the arising of this knowledge, there is the cessation of ignorance. “With the cessation of ignorance comes the cessation of formations… Thus is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.” In this way, the ending of the round, rooted in wise attention, should be understood. Thus, the entire sutta that follows is connected to these two terms."

And even with respect to an object or sense-object previously experienced, if for a certain person āsavas did not arise before, either due to his natural purity or through one of the practices such as studying, questioning, recitation, new work, or wise attention, but then later they arise suddenly due to a similar condition, these too are to be understood as “unarisen āsavas arising.” But when they arise again and again in relation to those very same objects and sense-objects, they are said to be “arisen āsavas that increase.” For otherwise, there is no such thing as the increase of what has first arisen."

Come now, I will practice for their uprooting.” Then, through the development of the path, he uproots them all. For him, those āsavas are said to be “unarisen and do not arise.” But for one who, while being a doer, has āsavas suddenly arise due to a lapse of mindfulness, and who then, becoming agitated, strives wisely and eradicates those āsavas, for him, they are said to be “arisen and are abandoned,” as in the case of the Elder Mahātissabhūta, resident of Maṇḍalārāma. It is said that he was learning the recitation in that very monastery. Then, while he was walking for alms in the village, a defilement arose in him concerning a dissimilar object. Suppressing it with insight, he went to the monastery. That object did not appear to him even in a dream. Thinking, “This defilement, having grown, will lead to the lower realms,” he aroused a sense of urgency. After taking leave of his teacher, he departed from the monastery, and in the presence of the Elder Mahāsaṅgharakkhita, he took up the meditation subject of impurity, which is the antidote to lust. He then entered a thicket, spread out his rag-robe, and sat down. With the path of a non-returner, he cut off the lust related to the five strands of sensual pleasure. Rising up, he paid homage to his teacher and on the next day, he attained the path of recitation. But for those that have arisen in the present moment, there is no abandoning by means of practice."

Now, taking this very phrase, “and arisen āsavas are abandoned,” to reveal another cause of abandoning those āsavas that are abandoned, in various ways, the King of Dhamma, who is skilled in the divisions of teaching, extending the discourse, said, **“There are, bhikkhus, āsavas to be abandoned by vision,”** and so on. Therein, **to be abandoned by vision** means to be abandoned by the vision of the path of stream-entry. This is the method in all cases."

Now, wishing to explain those phrases in sequence, having posed the question, “And which, bhikkhus, are the āsavas to be abandoned by vision?” he began the discourse based on the person, saying, “Here, bhikkhus, an uninstructed ordinary person,” in the same way as was said in the commentary on the Mūlapariyāya Sutta. Therein, **does not know the dhammas that should be attended to** means he does not know the dhammas that should be adverted to, that should be brought to mind. **Those that should not be attended to** means the opposite of those. This is the method in the remaining phrases as well. But since there is no fixed rule in terms of the dhammas themselves that “these dhammas should be attended to, these should not be attended to,” there is, however, a rule in terms of the mode. The mode in which, when they are being attended to, they become a basis for the arising of the unwholesome—in that mode they should not be attended to. The mode in which they become a basis for the arising of the wholesome—in that mode they should be attended to. Therefore, he said, **“For him, bhikkhus, by attending to a dhamma, the unarisen āsava of sensuality,”** and so on."

Therefore, just as when it is said, “Bhikkhus, whatever beings are without feet or with two feet... the Tathāgata is declared the chief among them,” the meaning is ‘both without feet and with two feet’; and just as when it is said, “for the maintenance of beings that have come to be, or for the support of those seeking to be born,” the meaning is ‘both of beings that have come to be and of those seeking to be born’; and just as when it is said, “from fire or from water or from discord,” the meaning is ‘both from fire and from water and from discord’; so too here, the meaning should be understood as ‘both the unarisen āsava of sensuality arises, and the arisen āsava of sensuality increases’.

In this way, the āsava of views is also included in the āsava of existence. The **āsava of ignorance** is the lack of knowledge concerning the four truths. Therein, for one who attends with relish to the strands of sensual pleasure, both the unarisen āsava of sensuality arises, and the arisen one increases. For one who attends with relish to the sublime states, both the unarisen āsava of existence arises, and the arisen one increases. It should be understood that for one who attends to the dhammas in the three planes as being a basis for the four perversions, both the unarisen āsava of ignorance arises, and the arisen one increases.

It should not be said, “For what reason?” For a foolish ordinary person acts in any way whatsoever, like a madman. Moreover, unwise attention itself is the reason here. But what is the reason for such unwise attention? That very state of being an ordinary person, or not seeing the noble ones, and so on. But does not an ordinary person also attend wisely? Who says he does not attend? But the state of being an ordinary person is not the reason there; hearing the good Dhamma, having noble friends, and so on, are the reasons there.

Having thus shown doubt in its sixteen varieties, now this discourse has been undertaken to explain the canker of views, with this doubt as its basis. Explaining this, he said, **For one who attends improperly in this way, one of six views arises**, and so on. Herein, it is meant that for that person who attends improperly in such a way that this doubt arises, because that improper attention of the doubter has gained strength, one of the six views arises. Therein, in all instances, the word 'or' is used in the sense of an alternative; it is meant that a view arises in this way or that way. Here, in **I have a self**, the eternalist view grasps one's own existence in all times. **As true and enduring** means as real and as stable; it is meant that one grasps it as ""This is true,"" as real, and with great firmness. **I have no self**, however, is the annihilationist view, because it grasps the non-existence of an existing being in various places. Alternatively, the former is the eternalist view from grasping ""it exists"" in the three times, while one who grasps ""it exists"" only in the present holds the annihilationist view. The latter, too, from grasping ""it does not exist"" in the past and future, is the annihilationist view, like that of those who hold the view that one is annihilated with the ashes. One who grasps ""it did not exist"" only in the past holds an eternalist view, like that of one who believes in spontaneous arising."

One experiences the result of wholesome and unwholesome kamma in various spheres. **In various spheres** means in those various wombs, destinations, states, abodes, classes of beings, or sense-objects. **Permanent** means devoid of arising and passing away. **Stable** means firm, essential. **Eternal** means existing at all times. **Not subject to change** means having the nature of not abandoning its own intrinsic state; like a chameleon, it does not assume various forms. **Like unto the eternal** — the moon, sun, ocean, great earth, and mountains are called 'eternal' in worldly parlance. **Like unto the eternal** means equal to the eternal things.

Or, because this seeing has gone among the views, being included within the sixty-two views, it is also 'what is gone to by view'. Or, 'gone to by view' is 'what is gone to by means of view'. For this is merely the process of the view “there is a self for me,” and so on; it is meant that herein there is no one who is a self or is permanent. And this view, in the sense of being difficult to escape, is a **thicket**. In the sense of being difficult to cross and in the sense of being perilous, it is a **wilderness,** like a wilderness of famine, a wilderness of wild beasts, and so on. In the sense of being pierced by right view, or in the sense of being perverse, it is a **side-track**. Because it sometimes grasps eternalism and sometimes annihilationism, it is a distorted agitation, thus it is **agitation**. In the sense of binding, it is a **fetter**. Therefore, he said, “a thicket of views… a fetter of views.” Now, showing that very sense of binding, he stated, “bound by the fetter of views,” and so on. The following is its summary meaning.

Here, indeed, up to the path of stream-entry, insight is spoken of under the heading of attention. And that craving which is the originator, the producer of that very suffering, he wisely attends to as, **‘This is the origin.’** And since suffering and its origin, upon reaching this state, cease and do not occur, therefore, that which is called **Nibbāna**, he wisely attends to as, **‘This is the cessation of suffering.’** The eightfold path that leads to cessation, he wisely attends to as, **‘This is the practice leading to the cessation of suffering,’** that is, he brings it to mind and sees it with method, with the way."

Therefore, having apprehended the four elements in his own continuum by the method beginning, “In this body there is the earth element, the water element,” and so on, and the derived forms in accordance with them, he determines, “This is the form-aggregate.” When mental and mental-concomitant states with that form as their object arise for him who is so determining, he determines, “These are the four formless aggregates.” Then he determines, “These five aggregates are suffering.” But in brief, they are just two parts: mentality and materiality. And this mentality-materiality arises with a cause, with a condition. He determines the causes and conditions, such as ignorance, existence, craving, kamma, and nutriment, thinking, “This is its cause, this is its condition.” Then, having determined the true characteristic nature of those conditions and the conditionally arisen phenomena, he applies the characteristic of impermanence, thinking, “These phenomena, having not been, come to be”; he applies the characteristic of suffering, thinking, “They are suffering because they are oppressed by rise and fall.” He applies the characteristic of non-self, thinking, “They are non-self because they are not subject to one's will.” Thus, having applied the three characteristics and developing insight sequentially, he attains the path of stream-entry."

He penetrates suffering through the penetration of full understanding, the origin through the penetration of abandonment, cessation through the penetration of realization, and the path through the penetration of development. And he fully understands suffering through the full understanding of comprehension... he fully understands the path through the full understanding of development, but not with different kinds of knowledge. For with a single knowledge, he both penetrates and fully understands cessation as the object and the remaining truths through their function. For at that time, it does not occur to him, “I am fully understanding suffering,” or... “I am developing the path.” And yet, for him who is realizing cessation by making it the object through the power of penetration, that very knowledge also performs the function of fully understanding suffering, the function of abandoning the origin, and the function of developing the path. For one attending wisely in this way, three fetters are abandoned: identity-view with its twenty bases, doubt with its eight bases, and misapprehension of precepts and practices from misapprehending precepts and practices as “purification is through precepts, purification is through practices.” Therein, among the four cankers, since identity-view and misapprehension of precepts and practices are included in the canker of views, they are both cankers and fetters. Doubt is only a fetter, not a canker. But because it is included in the phrase “cankers to be abandoned by seeing,” it is called a canker."

However, the *āsava* of becoming (*bhavāsavo*), which has the characteristic of being abandoned together, arises in the four types of consciousness dissociated from wrong view, by way of wishing for the powers of *nāgas*, *supaṇṇas*, and so on. Associated with that, the *āsava* of ignorance (*avijjāsavo*) is also abandoned; the *āsava* of ignorance that produces the killing of living beings and so on in the two consciousnesses rooted in grief is also abandoned; likewise, the *āsava* of ignorance associated with the consciousness of doubt is also abandoned. Thus, in every way, the remaining three *āsavas* are abandoned. Therefore, the meaning here should be understood thus: the exposition was made in the plural. This is the intention of the ancients."

Why is the path of stream-entry called ‘seeing’? Because of seeing *nibbāna* for the first time. But does not *gotrabhū* see it even earlier? It is not that it does not see. But having seen, it does not perform the task that needs to be done, because of not having abandoned the fetters. Therefore, it should not be said that it ‘sees’. An example here is a villager who, having seen the king somewhere, but not having had his task accomplished by giving a gift, says, “I still have not seen the king.”"

Why then does He show separately those to be abandoned by restraint and so on? The *āsavas* that are suppressed in the preliminary stage by restraint and so on are eradicated by the four paths. Therefore, He spoke thus to show the abandoning by suppression through these five methods in the preliminary stage of those paths. Therefore, this which was spoken of first is the path of seeing. Now, the three paths will be spoken of by the name of development. It should be known that this is the preliminary practice for all of them."

And here, the wise reflection should be understood as the reflection on the danger in non-restraint. And that should be understood in the manner of the Discourse on the Fire, which begins: “Monks, it is better that the eye faculty be wiped with a heated iron rod, blazing, afire, and glowing, than that there be the grasping of a sign by way of its details in forms cognizable by the eye.” In the phrase **he dwells restrained with the restraint of the eye faculty**, eye itself is faculty, hence eye-faculty. Because it restrains, it is restraint; it means covering, shutting. This is a synonym for mindfulness. Restraint in the eye faculty is eye-faculty-restraint. It is like ‘a crow on the bank,’ ‘a tortoise in a pit,’ ‘a buffalo in the forest,’ and so on."

Then, eye-consciousness, the function of seeing; then, resultant mind-element, the function of receiving; then, resultant rootless mind-consciousness-element, the function of investigating; then, functional rootless mind-consciousness-element, accomplishing the function of determining, arises and ceases. Immediately after that, *javana* impels."

Even when it is like this, it is called non-restraint in the eye faculty. Why? Because when that is present, the door is unguarded, and so are the *bhavaṅga* and the cognitive-process consciousnesses such as adverting. Like what? It is like when the four gates of a city are unrestrained; although the houses, storerooms, and inner chambers inside are well restrained, still all the goods within the city are unprotected and unguarded. For thieves, having entered through the city gate, could do whatever they wish. In the very same way, when immorality and so on have arisen in the *javana*, when that non-restraint is present, the door is unguarded, and so are the *bhavaṅga* and the cognitive-process consciousnesses such as adverting."

For when the city gates are closed, there is no entry for thieves. In the very same way, when virtue and so on have arisen in the *javana*, the door is well guarded, and so are the *bhavaṅga* and the cognitive-process consciousnesses such as adverting. Therefore, although arising at the moment of *javana*, it is called restraint in the eye faculty. And here it should be understood that this restraint by mindfulness is intended. Restrained by the restraint of the eye faculty is **restrained with the restraint of the eye faculty**; it means endowed with. Indeed, in the analysis of the phrase ‘restrained with the restraint of the *pātimokkha*’, it is said, “he is endowed with this restraint of the *pātimokkha*... furnished with.” Taking that together, the meaning should be understood thus: restrained by the restraint of the eye faculty."

He has restrained in the restraint of the eye faculty is ‘he has restrained with the restraint of the eye faculty.’ It means he has restrained, shut, closed the gate of mindfulness called ‘restraint of the eye faculty’ at the eye-door, just as one does a gate at the door of a house. This very meaning is more excellent here. Indeed, in such passages as “for one dwelling unrestrained in the restraint of the eye faculty, for one dwelling restrained,” this very meaning is seen."

It is a factor of that enlightened one (*bodhi*), thus it is an enlightenment factor (*bojjhaṅga*), just like the constituents of an army, the constituents of a chariot, and so on. Therefore, the commentary masters said: ""Or, they are factors of the person who is awakening, thus they are enlightenment factors."" Furthermore: ""Enlightenment factors, in what sense are they enlightenment factors? They lead to enlightenment, thus they are enlightenment factors; they awaken, thus they are enlightenment factors; they awaken in conformity, thus they are enlightenment factors; they awaken from sleep, thus they are enlightenment factors; they fully awaken, thus they are enlightenment factors."" By this method from the Paṭisambhidā, the meaning should also be understood. A praiseworthy or beautiful enlightenment factor is a *sambojjhaṅga*. Thus, mindfulness itself is an enlightenment factor (*sambojjhaṅga*), hence *satisambojjhaṅga*. That **enlightenment factor of mindfulness**. In this way, the determination of one initial term should be understood by its meaning and by its characteristics, and so on."

Three are opposed to restlessness. As was said: “And when, monks, the mind is restless, that is the time for the development of the tranquility enlightenment-factor, the time for the development of the concentration enlightenment-factor, the time for the development of the equanimity enlightenment-factor.” One among them is applicable everywhere. As was said: “And mindfulness, monks, I say is applicable everywhere.” There is also the reading *sabbatthakaṃ*; the meaning for both is that it is desired in all situations. Thus, because they are counterparts to sloth and restlessness and because one is applicable everywhere, only seven enlightenment-factors are stated, neither fewer nor more. In this way, the determination as to their being neither fewer nor more should be understood here."

This is of five kinds: seclusion by substitution of opposites, seclusion by suppression, seclusion by cutting off, seclusion by tranquilization, and seclusion by escape. Its diversity should be understood in the same way as was stated in the section on “one who is untrained in the noble Dhamma.” For this very thing was called discipline there. Thus, in this fivefold seclusion."

For this yogī, dedicated to developing the enlightenment-factors, at the moment of insight, develops the enlightenment-factor of mindfulness based on seclusion by substitution of opposites in terms of function and based on seclusion by escape in terms of intention. But at the time of the path, he develops it based on seclusion by cutting off in terms of function and based on seclusion by escape in terms of the object. Some say, “based on the fivefold seclusion.” They do not extract the enlightenment-factors only at the stages of strong insight, path, and fruition, but also extract them in the *jhānas* of *kasiṇa*, mindfulness of breathing, foulness, and the divine abidings, which are the basis for insight. And this is not rejected by the commentary masters. Therefore, according to their opinion, at the moment of occurrence of these *jhānas*, it is based on seclusion by suppression in terms of function. And just as it was said, “at the moment of insight, based on seclusion by escape in terms of intention,” so too it is proper to say that one develops it based on seclusion by tranquilization. This is the method for **based on dispassion**, etc. For dispassion and the others have the same meaning as seclusion."

Therein, **relinquishment as abandoning** is the abandoning of defilements at the moment of insight by way of substitution of opposites, and at the moment of the path by way of cutting off. **Relinquishment as plunging into** is the plunging into Nibbāna at the moment of insight by being inclined toward it, and at the moment of the path by making it the object. Both of these are suitable in this explanatory method that mixes the mundane and the supramundane. For this enlightenment-factor of mindfulness abandons defilements and plunges into Nibbāna in the way stated. By the entire phrase **maturing in relinquishment**, it means maturing toward relinquishment, being matured, ripening, and being ripened. This is what is meant: “This bhikkhu, dedicated to developing the enlightenment-factors, develops the enlightenment-factor of mindfulness in such a way that it ripens toward the state of relinquishment as abandoning defilements and the state of relinquishment as plunging into Nibbāna, and in such a way that it becomes ripened.” This is the method for the remaining enlightenment-factors."

The path itself matures in relinquishment. Therefore, one develops the enlightenment-factor of mindfulness that is based on seclusion due to its arising with seclusion as its object. Likewise, **based on dispassion** and **based on cessation**. And this very meaning should be seen: that it has matured and ripened at the moment of the arising of the noble path through the abandoning by cutting off defilements and through the plunging into Nibbāna. This is the method for the remaining enlightenment-factors."

Therein, **when** has the particle *to* in the genitive sense; it means “of whom.” The ancients, however, explain it as “at which time.” **The cankers that are to be abandoned by seeing**: the cankers that are to be abandoned by seeing are abandoned by seeing itself; one does not perceive them as abandoned when they are not yet abandoned.

And since its exposition is based on an occasion of utterance, we will first show that occasion and then provide the commentary on its unprecedented words. On what occasion, then, was this discourse delivered? On the occasion of gains and honor. It is said that great gains and honor arose for the Blessed One. This was as befitting one who had an accumulation of the perfection of giving fulfilled over four incalculable aeons. Just as a great twin-cloud, having arisen in all directions, would resemble a great flood, so too all the perfections, as if gathered together with the thought, “We will give our result in this one existence,” produced a great flood of gains and honor. From all directions, Khattiyas, Brahmins, and others came with food, drinks, vehicles, clothing, garlands, perfumes, and ointments in their hands, searching for the Blessed One, asking, “Where is the Buddha? Where is the Blessed One? Where is the deva of devas, the bull of men, the lion of men?” Even after bringing requisites by the hundreds of cartloads, they could not find an opportunity to offer them and stood with cart yokes touching cart yokes, covering a distance of a gāvuta all around, and they followed along. Like the Brahmins of Andhakavinda and others. Everything should be understood in the manner stated in the Khandhakas and in various suttas. And just as for the Blessed One, so it was for the Saṅgha of monks."

For just as when a full-length mirror is placed at a city gate, people of the four castes see their own reflection, abandon their blemishes, and become faultless, in the same way, sons of good family who are keen on the training, desiring to adorn themselves with the ornament of yogic practice, reflecting on this teaching that is like a full-length mirror, will avoid the practice of being heirs to material things and fulfill the practice of being heirs to the Dhamma, and will quickly make an end of birth, aging, and death.” Because of this occasion of utterance, he delivered this sutta."

Material things are also twofold: material things in the ultimate sense and material things in a relative sense. How so? The ninefold supramundane Dhamma, comprising the paths, fruits, and Nibbāna, is the **Dhamma in the ultimate sense**. It is the Dhamma that has been produced; it is not the Dhamma in any relative sense, by way of any reason or pretext. But as for that wholesome state that is conducive to the unbinding—namely, when someone here, aspiring for the unbinding, gives gifts, undertakes the moral precepts, observes the Uposatha, performs offerings to the sacred objects with perfumes, garlands, and so on, listens to and teaches the Dhamma, and produces the jhānas and attainments; by doing so, one gradually attains the Dhamma in the ultimate sense, the deathless Nibbāna—this is the **Dhamma in a relative sense**. Similarly, the four requisites, such as robes, are **material things in the ultimate sense**; they are not material things in any other relative sense, by way of any reason or pretext. But as for that wholesome state that leads to the cycle of rebirth—namely, when someone here, aspiring for the cycle of rebirth, desiring a state of fortunate existence, gives gifts... and so on... produces the attainments; by doing so, one gradually attains fortunate states among devas and humans—this is called **material things in a relative sense**."

For it is because it was taught by the Blessed One that monks realize the paths, fruits, and Nibbāna. And this has been said: “For that Blessed One, Brahmin, is the producer of the unarisen path, the generator of the unoriginated path, the declarer of the undeclared path. He is the knower of the path, the discoverer of the path, the one skilled in the path.” And, “And now, venerable sir, the disciples dwell following the path, endowed with it afterwards.” And, “For that Blessed One, friends, knowing, knows; seeing, sees. He is the Eye, he is the Knowledge, he is the Dhamma, he is the Brahmā; the proclaimer, the expounder, the leader to the goal, the giver of the deathless, the Lord of the Dhamma, the Tathāgata.” The pariyāya-dhamma also belongs to the Blessed One. For it is because it was taught by the Blessed One that they know thus: “One who gives a gift desiring that which is free from the round… and so on… who produces attainments, in due course obtains the deathless, Nibbāna.” And the nippariyāya-āmisa also belongs to the Blessed One. For it was only because it was permitted by the Blessed One that the bhikkhus received fine robes, beginning with the case of Jīvaka. As he said: “I allow, bhikkhus, a householder’s robe. Whoever wishes, let him be a wearer of refuse-rag robes; whoever wishes, let him accept a householder’s robe. In either case, bhikkhus, I praise only contentment.”"

Similarly for lodgings. For formerly, bhikkhus had only lodgings such as unprepared rock-clefts and the roots of trees. It was only because it was permitted by the Blessed One in this way—“I allow, bhikkhus, five kinds of dwellings”—that they received these lodgings: a monastery, a gabled house, a long-house, a mansion, and a cave. And formerly, they made medicine only with fermented myrobalan fruit. It was only because it was permitted by the Blessed One in this way—“I allow, bhikkhus, five medicines, that is: ghee, fresh butter, oil, honey, and molasses”—that they received various medicines."

But he sees the attainment of qualities such as the supernormal knowledges and analytical knowledges by those devoted to the Dhamma, such as Sāriputta, Moggallāna, and Mahākassapa. Therefore, desiring their release from the lower realms and the full possession of all qualities, he said: “I have compassion for you. How might my disciples become heirs in Dhamma, not heirs in material things?” And one who is devoted to requisites is without majesty and without splendor in the midst of the four assemblies, like a counterfeit coin or like an extinguished ember. One who is devoted to the Dhamma, with a mind turned away from that, is powerful and moves with dominance like a lion; therefore, he also said: “I have… and so on… not heirs in material things.”"

Therein, **“You too would on that account be pointed at”** means: you too, by that state of being heirs in material things and not being heirs in Dhamma, would be pointed at.

Whose pupils are these?”; or just as, upon seeing immoral young men and women of bad character, people censure their parents, asking, “Whose sons are these?

In ""The earth element might be internal, might be external,"" it is used in the sense of 'certainty'. In ""Might some bhikkhu have transgressed an offense?"" it is used in the sense of 'supposition'. Here, both are suitable. An **""excessive item""** is simply what is in excess. Likewise, a **""discardable item""**.  The meaning is: it is extra and it should be discarded; nothing else is to be done. **""Then""** means at that time. **""Afflicted by hunger and weakness""** means afflicted, touched, and overcome by both hunger and weakness for eight or even ten days. Therein, some, though hungry, are not weak; they are able to endure hunger. To show that these, however, are not like that, he said both. **""To them I""** means to them I. **""If you wish""** means if you desire."

By this, both a place without grass and a thicket of tall grass where the grass would not be destroyed even if almsfood were discarded from a cart, are included.  For this was said in order not to violate the training rule concerning living plants."

For it is only in a small amount of water that minute creatures die when stirred up by the addition of food, not in large lakes and so on.

Also in the context of planting, in passages such as, ""As an autumn seed, sown (*vutta*) in a field, sprouts."" Also in the context of being spoken, in passages such as, ""This was said (*vutta*) by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant."" Here, however, it should be understood in the sense of 'spoken'. For its meaning is 'this has been spoken'. **""One kind of material thing""** means one of the four material requisites; the meaning is 'one'. **""That is""** (*yadidaṃ*) is a particle; in all genders, cases, and numbers it should be construed according to the meaning in each respective place. Here, however, its meaning is 'that which is'. That which is called almsfood. It is said to be 'one kind of material thing'. **""What if I were to""** means 'it would be good if I were to'. **""Thus""** means day and night in the same way that I am now passing this moment. **""I would spend""** means I would pass, I would cause to pass by."

If that bhikkhu, while thinking, ""What if I were to pass the time…,"" were to think thus: ""Indeed, for one gone forth, it is difficult to seek even alms-food in a village teeming with the wild beasts of the five strands of sensual pleasure, just as it is to seek medicine in a forest teeming with wild beasts."" This alms-food, however, is free from the flaws of having to be sought and so on, and it is a leftover from the Sugata; thus, it is like a Khattiya prince of pure birth on both sides. And there are five reasons for which alms-food should not be partaken of. That is to say, it should not be partaken of by censuring the person, thinking, ""It belongs to a shameless person."" It should not be partaken of due to impure origin, thinking, ""It has arisen from what was prepared by a bhikkhunī or from making a display [of higher states]."" It should not be partaken of out of compassion for the owner, thinking, ""The bhikkhu who owns the alms-food is hungry."" Even if he is satisfied, it should not be partaken of out of compassion for his resident pupils and others, thinking, ""The resident pupils or others connected to him are hungry."" And even if they are satisfied, it should not be partaken of due to faithlessness, thinking, ""The bhikkhu who owns the alms-food is faithless."" And this alms-food is free from those reasons. For the Blessed One is the foremost of the scrupulous; the alms-food is of pure origin; the Blessed One is satisfied and content; there is no other person who has expectations for it; and of those in the world who have faith, the Blessed One is the foremost. Having reflected thus, he might eat that alms-food and... etc... pass the time. By this much, the one who practices the ascetic's duties without eating has not eaten alms-food that should indeed be eaten. The one who practices the ascetic's duties after eating has eaten what should indeed be eaten. There is no distinction in the alms-food. But there is a distinction in the person. Therefore, to show that, he said, **""And although, bhikkhus, that bhikkhu...""** and so on."

What does it permit? It permits that bhikkhu’s blameless partaking of it. What does it praise? The practice of the ascetic's duties after having eaten. This is what is meant: even if that bhikkhu were to do what should be done after eating what should be eaten in this way. **""Yet that first bhikkhu is more...""** means: the first bhikkhu who practices the ascetic's duties after rejecting even that alms-food, he, among two brave men, is the braver, and among two wise men, the wiser, and is more to be revered and more to be praised. This is said to mean that he is more worthy of reverence and praise than the second bhikkhu."

The meaning is this: you might wonder, ""Why is that bhikkhu more to be revered and praised by the Blessed One?"" **""For, bhikkhus, that action of his""** means: because that rejection of alms-food will conduce for a long time to that bhikkhu's fewness of wishes... etc... to the arousal of energy. How so? If, at a later time, excessive desire, or evil desire, or great desire for requisites should arise in him, then he will restrain it with this goad of rejecting the alms-food, reflecting thus: ""Friend, having rejected even the alms-food leftover from the Sugata, have you generated such a desire?"" This is the method for restraining arisen discontent and lack of effacement. Thus, for him, it will first conduce to fewness of wishes, contentment, and effacement."

A certain person is easy to support and easy to maintain, both for himself and for his supporters. How so? One who, having received sour foods and so on, searches for non-sour foods; who, leaving what was received at one house at another house, wanders through the whole village and enters the monastery with an empty bowl and lies down—this one is difficult for himself to support. And one who, even when given a bowl filled with rice and meat, shows only a sullen face and displeasure, or who, right in front of them, disparages that alms-food, saying, ""What is this you have given?"" and gives it to novices, laypeople, and others—this one is difficult for his supporters to support. Seeing this, people avoid him from afar, thinking, ""This bhikkhu is difficult to support; he cannot be maintained."" But one who, having received anything, whether coarse or fine, eats with a contented mind and goes to the monastery to do his own work—this one is easy for himself to support. And one who, not disparaging the gift of others, whether it be little or much, coarse or fine, partakes of it right in front of them with a pleased and serene face and then leaves—this one is easy for his supporters to support. Seeing this, people become very confident and make a promise, ""Our venerable sir is easy to support; he is satisfied with just a little. We ourselves will maintain him,"" and they support him."

In this way, it will conduce to his being easy to support. And if laziness should arise in him, he will restrain that too with this same goad, reflecting thus: ""Friend, you who at that time, having rejected even the alms-food leftover from the Sugata, practiced the ascetic's duties even while afflicted by such hunger and weakness, are you now indulging in laziness?"" In this way, it will conduce to the arousal of his energy. Thus, for him, this rejection of alms-food will conduce for a long time to fewness of wishes... etc... to the arousal of energy.

As it is said: ""And, Ānanda, that talk which is for effacement, which is conducive to the dispelling of defilements from the mind, which conduces exclusively to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to full awakening, to Nibbāna."" ""That is to say, talk on fewness of wishes,"" etc., is the detailed explanation. Thus, these five qualities, being complete, will fulfill the ten topics of talk.

For, the fulfilled training in higher virtue is itself the virtue-aggregate of one beyond training; the training in higher mind is the concentration-aggregate of one beyond training; and the training in higher wisdom is itself the aggregates of wisdom, liberation, and knowledge and vision of liberation of one beyond training. Thus, the three trainings, being complete, will fulfill the five Dhammic aggregates of one beyond training. The five Dhammic aggregates, being complete, will fulfill the deathless Nibbāna. Just as on a mountaintop, a great monsoon cloud, having rained down heavily, fills the mountain clefts, pools, and streams. These being full fill the small chasms; the small chasms, the great chasms; the great chasms, the small rivers; the small rivers, the great rivers; and the great rivers fill the great ocean. In the very same way, for that bhikkhu, these five qualities, being complete, will fulfill everything from the ten topics of talk up to the deathless Nibbāna. Thus, this bhikkhu who has entered upon the path of being an heir to the Dhamma obtains the supreme inheritance of the Dhamma. Seeing this matter, the Blessed One said, “For what reason is this? It is because for that bhikkhu, bhikkhus,” and so on."

What is meant? Because whoever would practice the ascetic’s duties after eating that almsfood is devoid of these five root-qualities. But whoever would practice without eating is a partaker of these. ""Therefore, bhikkhus… and so on… not heirs to material things.”"

When entering to praise a person, he considers thus: “This theme that I have briefly stated but not explained in detail, the bhikkhus who are receptive to the Dhamma will take it up and, approaching either Ānanda or Kaccāna, they will ask. They will speak, aligning their explanation with my knowledge. Then the receptive bhikkhus will ask me again. To them I will say, ‘Well spoken, bhikkhus, by Ānanda; well spoken by Kaccāna. If you were to ask me about this matter, I too would explain it in the very same way.’ Thus I will praise those individuals. Then, developing reverence for them, the bhikkhus will approach them, and they in turn will enjoin the bhikkhus in the meaning and the teaching. Enjoined by them, those bhikkhus, by fulfilling the three trainings, will make an end of suffering.”"

Thus, this discourse, delivered through the single-minded intention of us both, will be paramount and authoritative, like a stone canopy. It will be like a boat placed at a ford for the purpose of crossing the four floods, and like a chariot yoked with four thoroughbreds for the purpose of travelling the path. And just as when a king, after establishing a command in the assembly, saying, ‘This is the penalty for one who does so,’ rises from his seat and ascends to the palace, a general seated right there enforces the command established by the king; in the same way, Sāriputta, seated in this very assembly, will praise and deliver the discourse I have established. Thus, this discourse, delivered with the intention of us both, will become more powerful and will blaze like the midday sun.” Thus, here he rose from his seat and entered the monastery in order to praise the Dhamma."

For if he were to go by physical movement, the entire assembly would follow, surrounding the Blessed One, and once dispersed, it would be difficult to reassemble. Thus, the Blessed One entered by the power of his mind."

Now, after the Blessed One had entered thus, the Venerable Sāriputta, wishing to praise that Dhamma in accordance with the Blessed One’s intention, said, “Then, venerable sirs…” and so on. Therein, “Venerable” is an endearing term. “Sāriputta” is that elder's name, and it is from his mother, not his father. For he was the son of the brahmin lady Rūpasārī; therefore, he is called Sāriputta. “Soon after he had departed” means not long after he had departed. As for “Venerable sirs, bhikkhus,” the Buddhas, the Blessed Ones, when addressing disciples, address them as “bhikkhus.” But the disciples, thinking, “Let us not be the same as the Buddhas,” first say “Venerable sirs” and then say “bhikkhus.” And when addressed by the Buddhas, the Saṅgha of bhikkhus replies with “Venerable Sir,” but when addressed by disciples, with “Venerable sir.”"

The particle “kho” is merely an indeclinable. “Of the Teacher who is dwelling in seclusion” means of the Teacher who is dwelling with the three kinds of seclusion: physical seclusion, mental seclusion, and seclusion from the bases of existence. “Do not train in accordance with that seclusion” means they do not train in accordance with any of the three kinds of seclusion; they are merely heirs to material things. With this meaning, the Venerable Sāriputta asked the bhikkhus. This same method applies to the bright-sided section as well."

Therein, **even from afar** means even from another country, even from another province, even from a distance counted in many yojanas, thus it is said. **Nearby** means in the vicinity. **To know** means to understand, to awaken to. **Let it be for the venerable Sāriputta to clarify** means let it be the venerable Sāriputta's portion; let the venerable Sāriputta, having made it his portion, analyze it, thus it is said. Indeed, the explanation of the meaning is the venerable one's portion, while our portion is the listening; this is the intention here. In this way, it is consistent with the characteristics of the language. Some, however, say that “let it be clarified” means “let it be seen.” Others, “let it arise in the mind.” **They will bear in mind** means they will learn it, they will master it. Then, desiring to speak to them, the elder said **Then** and so on. Therein, **then** is a word indicating a reason. The particle **hi** is a mere particle. Because you are eager to hear, and because you have placed this burden on me, therefore listen, thus it is said. Those bhikkhus also consented to the elder's word; therefore, it is said, “Yes, friend… and so on… they paid attention.”"

And this, moreover, is without alluding to the Blessed One being censured. Indeed, it is appropriate for the Blessed One, when censuring the disciples, to say, “I too would be censured for that,” but not for the disciples. This same method applies also to the bright side. This, for now, is the application of the method of connection."

But if he were speaking with reference to the three kinds of seclusion, there would be no distinction in the question. For this is the side of the explanation. Therefore, it should be understood that by this phrase he shows physical seclusion; by “and those states…” and so on, he shows mental seclusion; and by “given to abundance…” and so on, he shows the seclusion from the upadhis. In this way, the meaning here should be understood in brief."

They grasp the Dispensation loosely, thus they are **lax**. In **leaders in backsliding**, **backsliding** is a term for the five hindrances, in the sense of descent; thus, it is said that they are leaders in the five hindrances. **In seclusion** means in Nibbāna, the seclusion from the upadhis. **Having laid down the yoke** means having cast off the burden; not even making an effort to attain it. To that extent, they do not fulfill the seclusion from the upadhis, thus it is said."

Why? When it is said in a general way, such as “the disciples, for three reasons,” they might even be indifferent, thinking, “He must be speaking of someone else, not us.” But when it is specified, such as “the elders, the newly ordained, the middle ones,” they pay attention, thinking, “He is speaking about us.” It is like when a king says, “The city streets are to be cleaned by the ministers,” but they do not clean them, thinking, “Who is supposed to clean them?” But when the drum is beaten to announce, “Everyone should clean their own doorstep,” they all clean and decorate it in a moment. This analogy should be understood in the same way."

For in passages such as, “What kamma did the venerable Devānaminda do to attain this position?” it is seen in the sense of authority. In passages such as, “He is skilled in standing, a shooter of the instant,” it is seen in the sense of standing. In passages such as, “It is an occasion for the Tathāgata to understand this,” it is seen in the sense of occasion. In passages such as, “He understands a reason as a reason and a non-reason as a non-reason,” it is seen in the sense of cause. Here, however, it is in the sense of cause. Indeed, because the result stands in it, having its existence dependent on it, a cause is called a `ṭhāna` (standing-place)."

What must they have been like in their time as newly ordained and middle ones? Thus they are to be reproached. He shows that they receive this reproach, friends. Regarding **For the second reason**, here too, the construction should be made thus: Although they are called elders, friends, they do not abandon those states of greed and so on, which the Teacher said are to be abandoned. They do not attain mental concentration even for the duration of a finger-snap while sitting in solitude. What must they have been like in their time as newly ordained and middle ones? Thus they are to be reproached. He shows that they receive this reproach, friends. Regarding **For the third reason**, here too, the construction should be understood thus: Although they are called elders, friends, they do not subsist on whatever comes their way. They live devoted to the pursuit of adorning their robes, bowls, dwellings, and putrid bodies, not fulfilling the seclusion from the upadhis. What must they have been like in their time as newly ordained and middle ones? Thus they are to be reproached. He shows that they receive this reproach, friends. This is the method for the sections on the middle and newly ordained ones."

Indeed, these monks, even while being elders, frequent remote forest wildernesses that are a succession of leagues away; even when it is a suitable time to go to a dwelling near a village, they do not go. Thus, even with aged bodies, being of roused energy, they generate faith in the donors of requisites. By this first reason, thinking, “What must they have been like in their time as new and middle monks?” the elders are praiseworthy and receive praise. Having abandoned greed and so on, they fulfill seclusion of mind. Even when it is a suitable time for this great elder to sit surrounded by his resident pupils and co-residents, and while being of such an advanced age, having done his meal duties, he enters seclusion and comes out in the evening; having entered in the evening, he comes out in the morning. He does the preliminary kasina work, produces attainments, realizes the paths and fruits. In every way, he fulfills seclusion of mind. By this second reason, the elder monks are praiseworthy and receive praise. At a time when light robes with a pleasant touch, such as those made of linen, cotton, or silk, are suitable for the elder, even at such a time this great elder wears robes made of rags from a dust-heap. Taking up the teaching without laxity, with hindrances gone, having entered into the attainment of fruition, he dwells perfecting the seclusion from the aggregates. By this third reason, thinking, “What must he have been like in his time as a new and middle monk?” the elders are praiseworthy and receive praise. This is the method for the sections on middle and new monks."

Thus, having censured the practice of being an heir to material things in nine ways, and having praised the practice of being an heir to the Dhamma in nine ways, and having concluded the discourse in eighteen ways, those things to be abandoned were spoken of thus: “The Teacher speaks of the abandoning of certain dhammas, but they do not abandon those dhammas.” To show them in their own nature as “these are they,” he said this, beginning with “There, friends, both greed…” This is the connection."

It means in the teaching spoken of in the manner beginning with, “When the Teacher dwells in seclusion, the disciples do not train in seclusion.” **Both greed is evil, and hate is evil**—this shows that these two dhammas are evil, base, and should be abandoned. Therein, **greed** has the characteristic of coveting. **Hate** has the characteristic of corrupting. Of these, greed arises in the heir to material things upon the gain of requisites, and hate upon the lack of gain. Through greed, one yearns for what has not been gained; through hate, one becomes vexed when not gaining it. Greed arises regarding the object to be given, and hate arises toward the non-giver or the one who gives what is unpleasant. Through greed, one fulfills the nine dhammas rooted in craving; through hate, the five kinds of stinginess."

Its meaning is: for the abandoning of that evil greed and hate. **There is a middle path**—this was said with reference to the path. For the path does not approach, does not go toward these two extremes—greed as one extreme, hate as the other extreme; it is free from these extremes. Therefore, it is called the “middle path.” Because it exists in the middle of these, it is **“middle,”** and because it is to be practiced, it is **“path.”** Similarly, it should be elaborated in the same way as before: the indulgence in sensual pleasures is one extreme, the practice of self-mortification is the other extreme; eternalism is one extreme, annihilationism is the other extreme."

It conduces to the knowledge of the truths, in the sense of making them known; thus it is **knowledge-making**. And because it brings about the calming of lust and so on, **it conduces to peace**. Because it shows the state of being directly knowable of the four truths, **it conduces to direct knowledge**. **Enlightenment** is the path; because it conduces to that, **it conduces to enlightenment**. For the path itself conduces to the path, by accomplishing the task that is to be done by the path. **Nibbāna** is the unconditioned; because it conduces to the realization of that, to the direct experience of it, it is said that **it conduces to Nibbāna**.

It is a **path** because it goes while destroying the defilements, or it is sought by those who desire Nibbāna, or it is gone upon and practiced by them. **That is to say** is a particle. Its meaning is, “Which is that path?” or “What are those eight factors?” For each single factor is itself a path.

Having behaved thus, if he obtains gain as he wishes, he becomes stiff-necked and hard-hearted because of it, unable to be admonished with, “This should not be done in this way.” This is his **obstinacy**. But if someone says anything to him, such as, “This should not be done in this way,” his mind becomes agitated, his face scowls, and he speaks defiantly, “Who are you to me?” This is his **presumption**. Then, through obstinacy, he becomes conceited, thinking, “I alone am superior.” Through presumption, he becomes arrogant, despising others, thinking, “Who are these people?” This is his **conceit** and **arrogance**.

The position of Jāṇussoṇi, it is said, is the position of a royal chaplain. It was given to him by the king, therefore he is called ""Jāṇussoṇi"".

And the talk with which he exchanged greetings, such as ""Is Master Gotama well, is he keeping fit? Do Master Gotama and his disciples have little illness, little affliction, are they of light rising, strong, and dwelling in comfort?"", is **sammodanīyaṃ** (congenial) because it generates delight and joy, and because it is suitable for rejoicing. It is **sārāṇīyaṃ** (memorable) because it is worthy of being remembered, suitable to be continually brought to mind for a very long time due to the sweetness of its meaning and phrasing. It is congenial due to the pleasure of hearing it, and memorable due to the pleasure of recollecting it.

One sitting too near causes physical contact. One sitting upwind causes disturbance with the smell of their body. One sitting in a high place displays disrespect.

For going forth is also called **anagāriyā** because there is no household life in it; the meaning is that the work beneficial to a household, such as agriculture and cattle-herding, does not exist in it. A bhikkhu, too, is one who has no household, an anagāro; the state of an anagāro is anagāriyaṃ. **Pabbajitā** means have undertaken. Thus, in every way, it is said that they have undertaken the going forth or the state of a bhikkhu, which is designated as homelessness. **Pubbaṅgamo** means a leader who goes before. **Bahukāro** means of great help by performing what is beneficial. **Bhavaṃ tesaṃ gotamo samādapetā** means the venerable Gotama is the one who causes those sons of good family to undertake and train in the higher morality and so on. **Sā janatā** means that multitude of people. **Diṭṭhānugatiṃ āpajjatī** means they adopt the same course of views; the meaning is that whatever view the venerable Gotama holds, whatever he approves of, whatever he prefers, they too come to hold that view, to approve of that, and to prefer that."

Then, at a later time, after hearing the Blessed One's Dhamma-discourse of sweet flavor, they went forth from home out of faith and he saw them, content with the bare minimum of robes and almsfood, dwelling in forest hermitages, unafraid and unalarmed even though unguarded by anyone, joyful and elated, exultant and jubilant. Having seen this and reflecting, ""On whose account has this comfortable abiding arisen for these sons of good family?"" he gained confidence in the Blessed One, thinking, ""The ascetic Gotama.""

He says this with reference to those who did not go forth on account of debt, on account of fear, and so on. For the Blessed One is the leader only of such persons, not of others. **Durabhisambhavāni hī**ti means they are difficult to accomplish, hard to endure; it is said that they cannot be entered into by those of little merit. **Araññavanapatthānī**ti means forests and woodlands. Therein, although in the Abhidhamma it is stated without qualification, ""Having gone out beyond the city-pillar, all of that is forest,"" it should be understood that what is intended here is that dwelling which fulfills the ascetic practice of a forest-dweller, which is stated as ""a minimum of five hundred bow-lengths away."""

And here, setting aside this one meaning of **pariyantānaṃ**, the woodlands should be understood by the remaining meanings. **Pantānī**ti means secluded, very remote. **Dukkaraṃ paviveka**nti means bodily seclusion is difficult to do. **Durabhirama**nti means not easy to delight in. **Ekatte**ti means in solitude. What does this show? Even when bodily seclusion has been achieved, it is difficult to make the mind delight in it. For this world delights in pairs. **Haranti maññe**ti means they seem to carry away, they seem to devour. **Mano**ti means the mind. **Samādhiṃ alabhamānassā**ti means of one who does not attain access concentration or absorption concentration. What does this show? He thinks that for such a bhikkhu, the forests distract the mind with the sounds of grass, leaves, deer, and so on, and with various terrifying things.

It is also the reverence shown by others to oneself, or veneration with flowers and so on. **Fame** means the speaking of praise; **gain, honor, and fame** refers to gain, honor, and fame. **Desiring** means wishing for.

Then one day, an old ox, released from work, after grazing in the pasture by day, stood at night in that charnel ground, resting its head in a thicket of flowers and ruminating. When Piyagāmika came out from his walking meditation at night and heard the sound of its jaw, he thought, “Surely the king of the devas, knowing ‘This one is living in the charnel ground out of greed for gain,’ has come to harass me.” Raising his joined hands before the old ox, he stood all night pleading, “Good Sir, King of the Devas, please forgive me for this one night. From tomorrow onwards, I will not do so again,” while paying homage. Then, when the sun rose, seeing it, he struck it with a bamboo staff and drove it away, saying, “It terrified me all night long.”"

And in the counterpart to this, it is said, “I am one of established mindfulness,” from which this is to be apportioned to mindfulness. Wisdom is mentioned here to show the weakness of mindfulness. For mindfulness is of two kinds: that associated with wisdom and that dissociated from wisdom. Therein, that associated with wisdom is strong, while that dissociated is weak. Therefore, even when they have mindfulness, they are still unclearly comprehending and of lapsed mindfulness, because weak mindfulness lacks the function of mindfulness. To explain this meaning, it is said **unclearly comprehending**.

But there is no such thing as corrupted wisdom. **Eḷamūgā** means *elamukhā* (of flawed speech); the letter ‘kha’ has become ‘ga’. It means having slobbering speech. For when those of poor wisdom speak, slobber trickles from their mouths, and slobber is called *elā*. As it is said: “See the slobbering, fork-tongued serpent.” Therefore, they are called **eḷamūgā**. There is also the reading *elamukhā*. Some read it as *elamugā*, others as *elamukā*; in all cases, the meaning is *elamukhā*. How do they summon fear and terror? They, being of poor wisdom and slobbering speech, are not able even to make a determination of the object. For them, whose object is undetermined, while living in the forest, what was seen by day appears at night as a cause of fear and terror. “With agitated minds, they are startled and terrified by the slightest thing; seeing a rope or a vine, they perceive it as a snake; seeing a tree stump, they perceive it as a yakkha; seeing level ground or a mountain, they perceive it as an elephant; they are as if brought to ruin and disaster by snakes and the like.” In this way, by projecting that fear and terror onto themselves, they summon and invite it. Herein, in the phrase **I am endowed with wisdom**, **endowed with wisdom** means endowed with, possessed of, wisdom—not, however, with insight-wisdom, nor with path-wisdom, but rather with the wisdom of determining the object in these sixteen instances. This is the meaning. The rest is in every case as has been explained."

Because it is not a regular observance day. It is said that the fifth was not marked either before the Blessed Buddha had arisen or after he had arisen but not yet attained final Nibbāna. After his final Nibbāna, however, the elders who compiled the Dhamma considered, “Listening to the Dhamma happens too infrequently.” Then, having agreed, they established the fifth as a day for hearing the Dhamma. From that time on, it became a marked day. Thus, because it was not from all time, it is not included here."

But why do they have such perceptions? Either due to a lack of skill in emerging from meditation or due to the sound of birds. How so? Here, a certain person who has attained the white kasiṇa, having done the preliminary work during the day and entered into attainment during the day, forms the intention, ""I will emerge during the day,"" but he is not skilled in discerning the passage of time. He passes the day and emerges in the night. And due to the pervasion of the white kasiṇa, it is clear, distinct, and very distinct for him. Because of the intention he had formed, ""I will emerge during the day,"" and because of the clarity and distinctness from the pervasion of the white kasiṇa, while it is still night, he perceives it as day. Then there is a certain person who has attained the blue kasiṇa, having done the preliminary work at night and entered into attainment at night, forms the intention, ""I will emerge at night,"" but he is not skilled in discerning the passage of time. He passes the night and emerges in the daytime. And due to the suffusion of the blue kasina, it is unclear and indistinct for him. Due to the attention he had produced, ‘I will emerge at night,’ and due to the unclearness and indistinctness from the suffusion of the blue kasina, he perceives it as night even though it is day. Thus, firstly, they have such a perception due to a lack of skill in emerging."

Then birds that cry during the day, such as crows, thinking it is day because of the moonlight, cry at night, or for other reasons. Hearing their sound, he perceives it as day even though it is night. Or again, someone here might be sitting between mountains, in a deep mountain cave covered by a dense forest, at a time when the sunlight is hidden by a seven-day period of continuous rain. Then, birds that make sounds, such as owls, which cry at night, even at midday, while hidden here and there in deep darkness, make sounds either with the perception of it being night or for other reasons. Having heard their sound, he perceives it as night, although it is day. Thus, they have such perceptions from the sound of birds. **This I**: This is my perception in this way. **I say is in a state of delusion**: It is included within, pertaining to a state of delusion; it means, I say it is one of the states of delusion."

Even during a seven-day rainstorm, when the moon and sun were not visible, he knew, “This much of the pre-meal time has passed, this much of the post-meal time; this much of the first watch, this much of the middle watch, this much of the last watch.” Therefore, he spoke thus. And it is not surprising that the Bodhisatta who had fulfilled the perfections knows thus. For even for disciples who stand in partial knowledge, the distinction between night and day is clear."

Even when the sun was not visible, he would enter his dwelling early in the morning and emerge at that time. One day, the monastery attendants, thinking, “Tomorrow, let’s watch for the time the elder emerges,” prepared the meal and sat at the base of the time-post. The elder emerged precisely when the shadow was two finger-breadths long. It is said that from then on, even when the sun was not visible, they would strike the drum based solely on the sign of the elder's emergence."

And he did not use a mechanical water clock for the watches; other monks used them. Then, when the first watch had passed, just as the elder took the mallet and stood, or as he was striking it once or twice, the watch-mechanism would activate. In this way, after practicing the ascetic's duties for the three watches, the elder would enter the village early in the morning, take his alms food, return to the monastery, take his bowl at mealtime, go to his day-dwelling, and practice the ascetic's duties. The monks, seeing the time-post, would send for the elder to come without his seeing it. That monk would see the elder either just as he was leaving the day-dwelling or on the path in between. Thus, even for disciples established in partial knowledge, the distinction between night and day is clear; what then needs to be said of Bodhisattas?"

For when **for the good** is said, it means for the ultimate good, for Nibbāna. When **for the welfare** is said, it means for the path that leads to it; for there is no higher welfare than the path that leads to Nibbāna. When **for the happiness** is said, it means for the happiness of the attainment of the fruit, because there is no happiness higher than that. And it has been said: “This concentration is pleasant in the present and has a pleasant result in the future.”"

Therein, because when the mental body is tranquil, the physical body is also tranquil, it is said, ""my body was tranquil,"" without specifying ""mental body"" or ""physical body."" **Unagitated**: And that, precisely because it was tranquil, was unagitated; it means it was free from distress. **My mind was concentrated, one-pointed**: My mind, too, was well-placed, rightly established, as if in absorption. And precisely because it was concentrated, it was one-pointed, unshakable, and still. By this much, the preliminary practice for jhāna is described."

The only difference is that there it appears as “entering and abides,” whereas here it is “abode”; this is the only distinction. But by doing what did the Blessed One enter and dwell in these jhānas?

Among these, for those with destroyed taints, they are for the purpose of one-pointedness of mind. For having entered the attainment, they generate the eight attainments with just the wish, “With a one-pointed mind, we will dwell happily for the day,” after doing the preliminary work on a kasiṇa. For trainees and ordinary persons who generate them thinking, “Having emerged from the attainment, we will practice insight with a concentrated mind,” they are the basis for insight. But for those who, having generated the eight attainments, enter the jhāna that is the basis for the direct knowledges, and having emerged from the attainment, generate them while aspiring for the direct knowledges in the manner stated, “Being one, he becomes many,” they are the basis for the direct knowledges. But for those who, having generated the eight attainments, generate them thinking, “Having entered the attainment of cessation and become without a mind for seven days, we will dwell happily, having attained cessation, which is Nibbāna, in this very life,” for them they are the basis for the attainment of cessation. But for those who, having generated the eight attainments, generate them thinking, “Without having lost the jhāna, we will be reborn in the brahma world,” for them they are for the purpose of proceeding to a new existence."

For, at the moment of the path, the mind is being liberated; at the moment of fruition, it has been liberated. **In the liberated, the knowledge arose, “It is liberated”**: by this, he shows the reviewing knowledge. **Birth is destroyed**, etc.: with these words, he shows the domain of that [knowledge]. For, by that knowledge, the Blessed One, while reviewing, directly knew, “Birth is destroyed,” and so on. But which birth of the Blessed One was destroyed, and how did he directly know it? First, his past birth was not destroyed, because it had already been destroyed before. Not the future one, because there is no effort in the future. Not the present one, because it still exists. But that birth—distinguished as the one-, four-, or five-constituent [birth] in the one-, four-, or five-constituent existences—which would have arisen because the path had not been developed, that birth was destroyed by reaching the state of non-arising due to the path having been developed. He, having reviewed the defilements abandoned through the development of the path, directly knew this, knowing, “In the absence of defilements, even existing kamma becomes non-rebirth-linking in the future.”"

Therefore, the Blessed One, reviewing his own living of the holy life, directly knew, “The holy life has been lived.” **Done what had to be done**: the meaning is that the sixteen-fold duty in the four truths—by way of full understanding, abandoning, realizing, and developing through the four paths—has been completed. For the virtuous worldlings and others are [still] doing that duty; the one whose taints are destroyed has done what had to be done.

When this was said, the brahmin apparently thought: “The ascetic Gotama claims omniscience, yet even now he does not abandon dwelling in the forest. Could it be that he still has something else to do?” Then the Blessed One, knowing his intention, spoke in connection with this intention, saying, **“It might be, brahmin,”** and so on. Therein, **it might be, brahmin, that it occurs to you thus**: brahmin, it might sometimes occur to you thus. **But, brahmin, it should not be seen like this**: But, brahmin, this resorting to secluded lodgings by me should not be seen by you as being due to not being free from passion and so on. Having thus rejected the non-reason for resorting to secluded lodgings, to show the reason, he said, **“It is for two reasons, brahmin, that I,”** and so on. Therein, ‘atthavasa’ is simply ‘attha’ (reason, benefit). Therefore, **“It is for two reasons, brahmin, that I”** means: ‘I, brahmin, seeing two benefits, two reasons.’ **And for my own pleasant abiding in the here-and-now**: here, **the here-and-now** means this present personality. **Pleasant abiding** means the comfort of the four postures. For one dwelling alone in the forest, all postures are comfortable, even down to the act of urination and defecation. Therefore, the meaning should be understood as: for the pleasant abiding of the here-and-now. **And out of compassion for the future generation**: How is the future generation shown compassion through dwelling in the forest? When clansmen who have gone forth out of faith see the Blessed One’s dwelling in the forest, they will think, “Even the Blessed One, for whom there is nothing to be fully understood, nothing to be abandoned, nothing to be developed, and nothing to be realized, does not give up forest and secluded lodgings. What then of us?” And thinking thus, they will consider it necessary to dwell there. In this way, they will swiftly make an end of suffering. Thus, the future generation is shown compassion. To show this meaning, he said, “and out of compassion for the future generation.”"

For in passages such as, “Venerable sir, the night has passed, the first watch is over, the community of bhikkhus has been seated for a long time,” it is seen in the sense of passing away.

Or, he praises the Blessed One’s speech itself, referring to two meanings for each pair: The speech of Master Gotama is excellent for its dispelling of faults and excellent for its attainment of virtues; likewise, for its generation of faith and its generation of wisdom; for being with meaning and with phrasing; for its clear terms and its profound meaning; for being pleasant to the ear and for going to the heart; for not praising oneself and for not disparaging others; for being cool with compassion and for being purified by wisdom; for being pleasing on first hearing and for being able to withstand scrutiny; for being pleasant while being heard and for being beneficial when investigated—it should be connected in these and other similar ways."

As for **“and to the Dhamma and to the Bhikkhu Saṅgha,”** here, because it supports those who have attained the path, have realized cessation, and are practicing as instructed, by not letting them fall into the lower realms, it is the **Dhamma**. In terms of its essence, it is the noble path and Nibbāna. For it has been said: “As many as there are, monks, conditioned phenomena, the noble eightfold path is declared the chief among them.” The detailed explanation may be found there. And it is not only the noble path and Nibbāna, but also the Dhamma of the scriptures along with the noble fruits. For this has been said in the discourse on the celestial mansion of the young brahmin Chatta:"
s0201a.att,675,"‘‘Rāgavirāgamanejamasokaṃ, dhammamasaṅkhatamappaṭikūlaṃ;","“The Dhamma that is dispassion from lust, unshakeable, sorrowless, unconditioned, and unblemished;"

United by the conjunction of view and virtue, it is a **Saṅgha**. In terms of its essence, it is the community of the eight noble individuals. For this has been said in that very same discourse on the celestial mansion:"

That is to say, in terms of the word’s meaning, it destroys, thus it is a **refuge**. The meaning is that, for those who have gone for refuge, through that very act of going for refuge, it destroys and eliminates fear, terror, suffering, and the defilements of a bad destination. This is a designation for the Triple Gem itself."
s0201a.att,684,"Atha vā hite pavattanena ahitā ca nivattanena sattānaṃ bhayaṃ hiṃsati buddho. Bhavakantārā uttāraṇena assāsadānena ca dhammo. Appakānampi kārānaṃ vipulaphalapaṭilābhakaraṇena saṅgho.

Evaṃ tāva saraṇaṃ saraṇagamanaṃ yo ca saraṇaṃ gacchatīti idaṃ tayaṃ veditabbaṃ.","Alternatively, the Buddha destroys the fear of beings by engaging them in what is beneficial and restraining them from what is unbeneficial. The Dhamma, by leading them out of the wilderness of existence and by giving them solace. The Saṅgha, by causing the attainment of abundant fruit even from small offerings. Therefore, by this method too, the Triple Gem is a refuge. The arising of a state of mind that has its defilements destroyed through confidence and reverence towards it, and that proceeds in the manner of having that as its ultimate resort, is the going for refuge. A being endowed with that goes for refuge. The meaning is that, with a state of mind of the kind described, one approaches it thus: “These three gems are a refuge for me, these are my ultimate resort.” Thus, first, **the refuge, the going for refuge, and the one who goes for refuge**—this triad should be understood."
s0201a.att,685,"Saraṇagamanappabhede pana duvidhaṃ saraṇagamanaṃ lokuttaraṃ lokiyañca.

Therein, the supramundane going for refuge for those who have seen the truths, at the moment of the path, succeeds in its function with regard to the entire Triple Gem by having Nibbāna as its object, through the cutting off of the corruptions of going for refuge. The worldly going for refuge succeeds for ordinary people by suppressing the corruptions of going for refuge, having the qualities of the Buddha and so on as its object. In terms of its essence, it is the attainment of faith in the bases such as the Buddha. And right view, which has faith as its root, is called the straightening of views among the ten bases of meritorious deeds."

Therein, **self-dedication** is the abandoning of oneself to the Buddha and so on, in this way: “Starting from today, I dedicate myself to the Buddha, to the Dhamma, to the Sangha.” **Making them one's final resort** is the state of making them one's final resort, in this way: “Starting from today, may you hold me as one who has the Buddha as my final resort, the Dhamma as my final resort, the Sangha as my final resort.” **Assuming the state of a disciple** is the assumption of the state of a disciple, in this way: “Starting from today, may you hold me as a disciple of the Buddha, of the Dhamma, of the Sangha.” **Prostration** is the utmost reverence towards the Buddha and so on, in this way: “Starting from today, I will perform acts of homage, rising up, raising my hands in reverence, and respectful conduct only to the three bases, namely the Buddha and so on. May you hold me thus.” Indeed, for one who performs even one of these four modes, the going for refuge is certainly taken."

In this way too, self-dedication should be understood. “Oh, that I might see the Teacher! I would see only the Blessed One. Oh, that I might see the Sugata! I would see only the Blessed One. Oh, that I might see the Perfectly Enlightened One! I would see only the Blessed One.” In this way, like Mahākassapa's going for refuge, the assumption of the state of a disciple should be seen."

He kissed the Blessed One's feet with his mouth and massaged them with his hands, and announced his name, ‘I am Brahmāyu, Master Gotama, the brahmin; I am Brahmāyu, Master Gotama, the brahmin.’” In this way, prostration should be seen."

Therein, that with fault occurs through self-surrender, etc., to other teachers and so on; it has an undesirable result. That without fault is through the act of death; because it has no result, it is fruitless. But for the supramundane, there is no breaking at all. For even in another existence, a noble disciple does not designate another as his teacher.

Or this is the reading: in a place where dust comes from, where it rises, under a bed, in a chaff storeroom, or among other vessels; the meaning is, wherever it is covered with dust. **Saṃkiliṭṭhatarā assa malaggahitā**: Here it is said that it is ""more defiled"" from being placed in a dusty place, and ""more covered in grime"" from not being used or cleaned. This is a question in response. Therefore, its meaning should be understood thus: ""Friend, if that bronze bowl were treated in this way, would it in time become so much more defiled and more covered in grime that it would be difficult to know whether it is an earthenware bowl or a bronze bowl, or not?"" The Elder, agreeing to this, said, ""So it is, friend."" Then the General of the Dhamma, to establish the simile, said, **Evameva kho**, and so on. Therein, the correspondence of the simile should be understood as follows: a person with stains is like a dirty bronze bowl. Receiving ordination in the presence of a person engaged in activities like practicing medicine is, for a person receiving ordination, like placing a dirty bronze bowl in a dusty place after not using it and so on. Like a dirty bronze bowl becoming even more defiled, so for that person, while following the example of his teachers and preceptors, is the gradual act of practicing medicine and so on. Remaining in this state, he dies with stains. Or, it is the gradual transgression of wrong conduct and wrong speech. Remaining in this state, he dies with stains. Or, it is the gradual transgression of pācittiya and thullaccaya offenses, the transgression of saṅghādisesa offenses, the transgression of pārājika offenses, the commission of heinous acts such as matricide. Remaining in this state, he dies with stains."

They are the ones who advise and instruct; upon seeing even the slightest heedlessness, they impose a penalty and repeatedly train him. For that person following the example of his teachers and preceptors, there is gradually correct practice. Remaining in this state, he dies without stains, which is like the dirty bronze bowl later becoming pure and bright. Or, gradually being established in pure virtue, having learned the word of the Buddha appropriate for himself, having undertaken the ascetic practices, having taken a meditation subject suitable for himself, having given up dwelling in a residence near a village, he dwells in a secluded residence. Remaining in this state, he dies without stains. Or, gradually, having done the preliminary work for a kasiṇa and having suppressed the defilements by producing the eight attainments; having risen from the jhāna that is the basis for insight, having temporarily removed the defilements with insight; the attainment of the fruit of stream-entry... and so on... the realization of arahantship.

Therein, **of those who are subject to wishes** means of those who follow wishes, of various kinds of kopa and appaccayo that have descended and arisen according to wishes; this is the meaning. **That herein a certain one** means: that by which such a wish would arise for a certain one here—that situation, that reason exists, is found; this is what is said. **I might have transgressed** means: I might be a transgressor. **And the monks might not know me** means: and the monks might not know me. What is the situation here? The state of desiring gain. Indeed, a monk desirous of gain, who is also naturally one who has made merit and is honored and respected by people, thinks thus: ""When the elders know that a monk has transgressed an offense, they inform the middle ones; they inform the new ones; the new ones inform the leftovers-eaters and others in the monastery; they inform the nuns who have come for instruction. In this way, the four assemblies come to know."" In this way, there is an obstacle to his gain. ""Oh, that I might indeed have transgressed an offense, and the monks might not know me!"""

Having thus become known and being overcome by disgrace, he enters even a hundred villages and, gleaning at a hundred doorsteps, departs with his bowl just as it was when washed.

This gain-seeker also knows some sort of fragmented Dhamma-talk. He sees bhikkhus who have gathered from two or three yojanas away at such places, listening to all-night Dhamma-sermons. He sees pleased young bhikkhus or sāmaṇeras giving a great shout of ""Sādhu! Sādhu!"" Then, on the second day, lay devotees ask the bhikkhus who have gone into the village, ""Venerable sirs, who preached the Dhamma?"" They say, ""So-and-so and so-and-so."" Hearing that, the pleased laypeople make great offerings to the Dhamma-preachers. Desiring that, he thought in this way. **It is proper**: preaching the Dhamma is the responsibility of the learned who are skilled in judgment.

Thus, this desire arises in him."" **It is proper**: exhortation and so on are the responsibility of the learned.

Thus he wishes for the honor of requisites. **It is proper**: A learned and virtuous one of the type described as ""dear, reverent, and to be developed"" is worthy of this kind of treatment.

But for a person whose domains of desire are unabandoned, upon seeing the bodily action that occurs due to the domains of desire, they are as if seen; and upon hearing the verbal action, they are as if heard. Therefore it is said, “are seen and are heard.” In the present they are seen; in the case of what is out of sight, they are heard, as in “It is said that a certain bhikkhu is of such a nature.” **Although**: this is a word of approval and censure.

What is sewn with thick, long thread is called **coarse by the thread**; it is diminished in touch, having a rough texture. What is colored with dye is called **coarse by the dye**; it is diminished in color, having a poor appearance. Although that bhikkhu is a wearer of a robe that is thus coarse by the knife, coarse by the thread, and coarse by the dye, yet these many domains of desire of his are unabandoned, are seen and are heard. Then the wise fellow monastics neither honor him… and so on… nor do they venerate him. **For what reason?**: Here **taṃ** is just a particle; **kissa hetu** means for what reason. **For his… and so on… are heard**: it means, because those evil things of his are heard. “Because these domains of desire are unabandoned”—this is the intention here."

And it should be understood that these three are mentioned here because of their extremely repulsive and disgusting nature. For people may prepare with spices and so on the carcasses of other animals, such as rabbits and pigs, and even eat them. But the carcasses of these are disgusting even when fresh; what then needs to be said when they have become putrid over time? **Having arranged**: means having increased, having filled up; it means, having taken a carcass and put it in a bronze bowl. **With another**: with another one. **Having covered**: having closed. **In the middle of the market**: at the entrance of a street crowded with many people, between the market stalls. **They would proceed**: they would go. **Like a worthy gift**: like a very pure thing, like a very pleasing thing. Moreover, it means like a gift for a bride. **Vadhukā** refers to a mother; a gift being brought to her is `jañña`. In both cases, the repetition is for the sake of respect or praise. There is also the reading “jaññajaññaṃ byā.”"

""Broken by water"" is when in some places there is either too much water or none at all; there too the crops do not grow, and the field is broken. ""Broken by saline soil"" is when a farmer, ploughing the ground four or five times in a certain area, makes it too deep, from which saline soil arises; there too the crop does not grow, and the field is broken. Such a field is not very fruitful, not of great benefit, for even if much is sown there, little is obtained. But through the removal of these four faults, the field becomes complete.

But his resident pupil, the Elder Tepiṭaka Cūḷanāga, said: ""In both places, the Pātimokkha restraint was spoken of by the Blessed One, for the Pātimokkha restraint itself is sīla."" Not allowing that there is any passage where the other three are called 'sīla,' he spoke and said: ""Restraint of the sense faculties is merely the guarding of the six doors; purity of livelihood is merely the production of requisites righteously and fairly; that which is dependent on requisites is merely using the received requisites after having reflected, 'This is for this purpose.'"" Unconditionally, the Pātimokkha restraint itself is sīla. For whomever that is broken, he cannot be said to guard the remaining things, just like a man whose head has been cut off cannot be said to guard his hands and feet. But for whomever that is unimpaired, he is able to restore the remaining things to their natural state and guard them, just like a man whose head is not cut off is able to protect his life and restore his other limbs to their natural state.

And here, a monk who, having taken up a meditation subject by way of samatha and vipassanā, enters an empty dwelling day and night and sits, should be known as “an augmenter of empty dwellings.” But it should be understood that even one who builds a one-storied mansion and so on is not an augmenter of empty dwellings."

By the words “Devoted to internal serenity of mind, not neglecting jhāna,” the training in higher mind is stated. By “endowed with vipassanā,” the training in higher wisdom is stated. But by “an augmenter of empty dwellings,” both trainings are included and stated: when augmenting empty dwellings by way of samatha, it is the training in higher mind, and by way of vipassanā, it is the training in higher wisdom. And here, by the words “devoted to internal serenity of mind, not neglecting jhāna,” only the concentration of mind that protects sīla is spoken of. By the word “with vipassanā,” the comprehension of formations that protects sīla is spoken of."
s0201a.att,809,"Kathaṃ  cittekaggatā sīlamanurakkhati? Yassa hi cittekaggatā natthi, so byādhimhi uppanne vihaññati, so byādhivihato vikkhittacitto sīlaṃ vināsetvāpi byādhivūpasamaṃ kattā hoti.

Being distressed by the disease, with a distracted mind, he may even destroy his sīla to bring about the pacification of the disease. But for one who has concentration of mind, he suppresses that pain of disease and enters an attainment. At the moment of attainment, the pain is far removed, and a stronger happiness arises. Thus, concentration of mind protects sīla."

For one who has no comprehension of formations, there is a strong sense of “mine” regarding his personality, as in “my form, my consciousness.” When met with such things as famine, disease, and fear, he may destroy his sīla to nourish his personality. But for one who has comprehension of formations, there is no strong sense of “mine” or attachment to his personality. When met with such things as famine, disease, and fear, even if his intestines come out, even if he becomes parched and dried up, or is cut into pieces a hundred or a thousand times, he will never destroy his sīla to nourish his personality. Thus, comprehension of formations protects sīla. And by the phrase “an augmenter of empty dwellings,” the augmentation, development, and continuous practice of these very two is shown."

For this has been said:"

And here it should be understood that the Blessed One is not speaking of the fulfillment of sīla and so on as a pretext for gain. For the Blessed One has cut off talk about the quest for food and does not utter speech connected to it; thus he advises his disciples. How then would he teach the fulfillment of virtue and so on as a means for gains? Rather, this was said according to the disposition of the person. For there might be some whose disposition is this: ""If we were not to weary ourselves for the four requisites, we would be able to fulfill virtue and so on."" It is according to the disposition of such ones that the Blessed One spoke in this way. Moreover, what are called the four requisites are a benefit of the essence of virtue. Thus, wise people, taking out what was stored in granaries and so on, not giving it even to their own children and not consuming it themselves, give it to the virtuous. Therefore, this was also said to show the benefit of the essence of virtue."

For devas too, not only humans, give requisites to those endowed with virtues such as sīla, like Sakka did for the Venerable Mahākassapa. **Mahapphalā mahānisaṃsā** (of great fruit, of great benefit): these two are one in meaning; only the expression is different. Or, because they bear great worldly happiness as their fruit, they are **mahapphalā**. Because they are conditions for the great supramundane happiness, they are **mahānisaṃsā**. For even a spoonful of almsfood given to one endowed with virtues like sīla, or a leaf-hut built and given on a piece of land measuring five ratanas, protects one from falling into a woeful state for many thousands of aeons, and in the end becomes a condition for the deathless element of final Nibbāna. In this context, the stories beginning with ""I gave milk-rice"" are relevant, or the entire **Petavatthu** and **Vimānavatthu** serve as evidence. Therefore, it shows that one who wishes for the great fruitfulness of the services done to oneself by the donors of requisites must also be endowed with virtues such as sīla."

For when the deceased father or mother of a bhikkhu, with a faithful mind thinks, ""Our relative, the elder, is virtuous and of good character,"" and recollects that bhikkhu, that very confidence of mind and that mere act of recollection becomes of great fruit and great benefit for them; it is indeed capable of protecting them from a woeful state for many hundreds of thousands of aeons and of leading them to the deathless in the end. For this was said by the Blessed One: ""Bhikkhus, for those bhikkhus who are accomplished in virtue, accomplished in concentration, in wisdom, in liberation, and in the knowledge and vision of liberation, even seeing them, I say, is of great help. Hearing them, recollecting them, going forth after them, approaching them, and attending on them, Bhikkhus, I say, is of great help for those bhikkhus."" Therefore, it shows that one who wishes for the great fruitfulness of their relatives' and kinsmen's confidence of mind and recollection of them must also be endowed with virtues such as sīla."

He stepped off the path, spread his outer robe at the foot of a certain tree, and sat down cross-legged. The children of the tree-deity, unable to remain in their own forms due to the elder's majestic virtue, made a discordant noise. The deity also shook the tree. The elder sat unshaken. That deity created smoke and flames, but could not make the elder move. Then, approaching in the guise of a female lay devotee, she paid homage and stood there. When asked, ""Who is that?"" she said, ""Venerable sir, I am the deity dwelling in this tree."" ""Did you create these disturbances?"" ""Yes, venerable sir."" And when asked why, she said: ""Venerable sir, because of the majesty of your virtue, my children were unable to remain in their own forms and made a discordant noise. I did this to make you leave."" The elder said: ""Then why did you not say at the very beginning, 'Venerable sir, please do not stay here; it is inconvenient for me'? But now, do not say anything. I would be ashamed if it were said, 'Mahādatta of Ariyakoṭi left due to fear of a non-human being.' For that reason, I will stay right here. You, however, may stay wherever you like for this one day."" Thus, one endowed with virtues such as sīla is an endurer of fear and terror. Therefore, it shows that one who wishes to be such a person must also be endowed with virtues such as sīla."
